Even the person who disagrees with his frankness has to admit that his motives and actions are sincere. He never hesitates to tell the truth and speak his mind, however cutting it may be. (Location 172)</p><p>He led the fight in Atlanta to equalize teachers’ salaries and was instrumental in the elimination of Jim Crow elevators in the courthouse. (Location 177)</p><p>My father never made more than an ordinary salary, but the secret was that he knew the art of saving and budgeting. (Location 182)</p><p>The church has always been a second home for me. As far back as I can remember I was in church every Sunday. (Location 194)</p><p>We were at the dinner table when the situation was discussed, and here for the first time I was made aware of the existence of a race problem. (Location 213)</p><p>That experience revealed to me at a very early age that my father had not adjusted to the system, and he played a great part in shaping my conscience. I still remember walking down the street beside him as he muttered, “I don’t care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.” (Location 225)</p><p>I didn’t retaliate at any point; I wouldn’t dare retaliate when a white person was involved. I think some of it was part of my native structure—that is, that I have never been one to hit back. (Location 238)</p><p>I said to myself, “One of these days, I’m going to put my body up there where my mind is.” (Location 245)</p><p>I had also learned that the inseparable twin of racial injustice was economic injustice. (Location 266)</p><p>in a plant that hired both Negroes and whites. Here I saw economic injustice firsthand, and realized that the poor white was exploited just as much as the Negro. (Location 269)</p><a href=#2-morehouse-college><h3 id=2-morehouse-college><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2 MOREHOUSE COLLEGE</h3></a><p>The professors were not caught up in the clutches of state funds and could teach what they wanted with academic freedom. They encouraged us in a positive quest for a solution to racial ills. (Location 304)</p><p>Henry David Thoreau’s essay “On Civil Disobedience” (Location 307)</p><p>I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. (Location 310)</p><p>my college training, especially the first two years, brought many doubts into my mind. It was then that the shackles of fundamentalism were removed from my body. (Location 333)</p><a href=#3-crozer-seminary><h3 id=3-crozer-seminary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3 CROZER SEMINARY</h3></a><p>It has been my conviction ever since reading Rauschenbusch that any religion that professes concern for the souls of men and is not equally concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them, and the social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion only waiting for the day to be buried. (Location 373)</p><p>Too often do educated ministers leave the people lost in the fog of theological abstraction, rather than presenting that theology in the light of the people’s experiences. (Location 382)</p><p>I see the preaching ministry as a dual process. On the one hand I must attempt to change the soul of individuals so that their societies may be changed. On the other I must attempt to change the societies so that the individual soul will have a change. (Location 398)</p><p>for as a Christian I believe that there is a creative personal power in this universe who is the ground and essence of all reality—a power that cannot be explained in materialistic terms. (Location 406)</p><p>I am convinced now, as I was then, that man is an end because he is a child of God. Man is not made for the state; the state is made for man. (Location 416)</p><p>Communism in theory emphasized a classless society, and a concern for social justice, though the world knows from sad experience that in practice it created new classes and a new lexicon of injustice. (Location 421)</p><p>capitalism can lead to a practical materialism that is as pernicious as the materialism taught by communism. (Location 435)</p><p>My reading of Marx also convinced me that truth is found neither in Marxism nor in traditional capitalism. Each represents a partial truth. (Location 440)</p><p>Nineteenth-century capitalism failed to see that life is social and Marxism failed and still fails to see that life is individual and personal. (Location 441)</p><p>War, horrible as it is, might be preferable to surrender to a totalitarian system—Nazi, Fascist, or Communist. (Location 447)</p><p>The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. (Location 468)</p><p>I became so enamored of the insights of liberalism that I almost fell into the trap of accepting uncritically everything that came under its name. (Location 485)</p><p>Liberalism’s superficial optimism concerning human nature caused it to overlook the fact that reason is darkened by sin. (Location 491)</p><p>there is one phase of liberalism that I hope to cherish always: its devotion to the search for truth, its insistence on an open and analytical mind, its refusal to abandon the best light of reason. (Location 499)</p><p>My study of Gandhi convinced me that true pacifism is not nonresistance to evil, but nonviolent resistance to evil. (Location 517)</p><p>True pacifism is not unrealistic submission to evil power, as Niebuhr contends. It is rather a courageous confrontation of evil by the power of love, in the faith that it is better to be the recipient of violence than the inflicter of it, since the latter only multiplies the existence of violence and bitterness in the universe, while the former may develop a sense of shame in the opponent, and thereby bring about a transformation and change of heart. (Location 519)</p><p>Niebuhr’s great contribution to theology is that he has refuted the false optimism characteristic of a great segment of Protestant liberalism. Moreover, Niebuhr has extraordinary insight into human nature, especially the behavior of nations and social groups. He is keenly aware of the complexity of human motives and of the relation between morality and power. His theology is a persistent reminder of the reality of sin on every level of man’s existence. (Location 523)</p><p>After reading Niebuhr, I tried to arrive at a realistic pacifism. In other words, I came to see the pacifist position not as sinless but as the lesser evil in the circumstances. (Location 530)</p><p>I felt that the pacifist would have a greater appeal if he did not claim to be free from the moral dilemmas that the Christian non-pacifist confronts. (Location 533)</p><p>in my recent seminary days, I was able to strengthen my spiritual life through communing with nature. The seminary campus is a beautiful sight, particularly so in the spring. And it was at this time of year that I made it a practice to go out to the edge of the campus every afternoon for at least an hour to commune with nature. (Location 554)</p><a href=#4-boston-university><h3 id=4-boston-university><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4 BOSTON UNIVERSITY</h3></a><p>Personalistic philosophy—the theory that the clue to the meaning of ultimate reality is found in personality. This personal idealism remains today my basic philosophical position. (Location 588)</p><p>positive social philosophy. One of the main tenets of this philosophy was the conviction that nonviolent resistance was one of the most potent weapons available to oppressed people in their quest for social justice. (Location 606)</p><p>William Cullen Bryant in saying, “Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again.” (Location 615)</p><p>If we are to go forward, we must go back and rediscover these precious values—that all reality hinges on moral foundations and that all reality has spiritual control. (Location 627)</p><a href=#5-coretta><h3 id=5-coretta><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5 CORETTA</h3></a><p>I never will forget, the first discussion we had was about the question of racial and economic injustice and the question of peace. (Location 646)</p><p>After an hour, my mind was made up. I said, “So you can do something else besides sing? You’ve got a good mind also. You have everything I ever wanted in a woman. We ought to get married someday.” (Location 648)</p><p>he had to suffer certain insults and even humiliation in order to survive in his community. The amazing thing is that he came through all of this with his courage undaunted, without becoming bitter. (Location 662)</p><p>But how else can we express the deep emotions of life other than in poetry? Isn’t love too ineffable to be grasped by the cold calculating hands of intellect? (Location 668)</p><p>like most human systems it fell victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has out-lived its usefulness. (Location 674)</p><p>More than anyone else, she taught Coretta her moral and ethical values, not by what she said alone, but also by her example. (Location 684)</p><p>She saw the greatness of the movement and had a unique willingness to sacrifice herself for its continuation. (Location 691)</p><a href=#6-dexter-avenue-baptist-church><h3 id=6-dexter-avenue-baptist-church><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>6 DEXTER AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH</h3></a><p>The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church had a rich history. Many outstanding ministers served there, including Dr. Vernon Johns. It was a very fine church with even greater possibilities. (Location 744)</p><p>one of my favorite operas—Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor. (Location 749)</p><p>I said to myself over and over again, “Keep Martin Luther King in the background and God in the foreground and everything will be all right. Remember you are a channel of the gospel and not the source.” (Location 766)</p><p>I arose early on Sunday morning—a custom I follow every Sunday in order to have an hour of quiet meditation. (Location 770)</p><p>Finally we agreed that, in spite of the disadvantages and inevitable sacrifices, our greatest service could be rendered in our native South. We came to the conclusion that we had something of a moral obligation to return—at least for a few years. (Location 798)</p><p>I was convinced that worship at its best is a social experience with people of all levels of life coming together to realize their oneness and unity under God. (Location 835)</p><p>I continued to study hard as usual. I rose every morning at five-thirty and spent three hours writing the thesis, returning to it late at night for another three hours. (Location 839)</p><p>some of the most implacable and vehement advocates of racial equality are consecrated white persons. (Location 857)</p><p>Although the Council never had a large membership, it played an important role. As the only truly interracial group in Montgomery, it served to keep the desperately needed channels of communication open between the races. (Location 866)</p><p>Anyone who starts out with the conviction that the road to racial justice is only one lane wide will inevitably create a traffic jam and make the journey infinitely longer. (Location 873)</p><a href=#7-montgomery-movement-begins><h3 id=7-montgomery-movement-begins><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7 MONTGOMERY MOVEMENT BEGINS</h3></a><p>Through each of these mediums E. D. Nixon worked fearlessly to achieve the rights of his people, and to rouse the Negroes from their apathy. (Location 898)</p><p>I was filled with joy when I found so many of them there; for then I knew that something unusual was about to happen. (Location 911)</p><p>As a result of reading that article, I was forced for the first time to think seriously on the nature of the boycott method. Up to this time I had uncritically accepted this method as our best course of action. Now certain doubts began to bother me. (Location 931)</p><p>From this moment on I conceived of our movement as an act of massive noncooperation. From then on I rarely used the word “boycott.” (Location 944)</p><p>Students of Alabama State College were cheerfully walking or thumbing rides. Job holders had either found other means of transportation or made their way on foot. Men were seen riding mules to work, and more than one horse-drawn buggy drove the streets of Montgomery that day. (Location 963)</p><p>They knew why they walked, and the knowledge was evident in the way they carried themselves. (Location 967)</p><p>Coretta’s opposition probably resulted in one of the luckiest decisions of my life. For when the bus protest movement broke out, I would hardly have been able to accept the presidency of the Montgomery Improvement Association without lending weight to the oft-made white contention that the whole thing was an NAACP conspiracy. (Location 991)</p><p>This argument was so convincing that we almost resolved to end the protest. But we finally agreed to let the mass meeting—which was only about an hour off—be our guide. If the meeting was well attended and the people were enthusiastic, we would continue; otherwise we would call off the protest that night. (Location 1008)</p><p>this speech had evoked more response than any speech or sermon I had ever delivered, and yet it was virtually unprepared. I came to see for the first time what the older preachers meant when they said, “Open your mouth and God will speak for you.” (Location 1066)</p><a href=#8-the-violence-of-desperate-men><h3 id=8-the-violence-of-desperate-men><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>8 THE VIOLENCE OF DESPERATE MEN</h3></a><p>from time to time strategic decisions would have to be made; we needed the best minds of the association to think them through and then make recommendations to the executive board. (Location 1108)</p><p>Knowing that Jemison and his associates had set up an effective private car pool, I put in a long-distance call to ask him for suggestions for a similar pool in Montgomery. (Location 1120)</p><p>The act of walking, for many, had become of symbolic importance. (Location 1137)</p><p>Christ furnished the spirit and motivation while Gandhi furnished the method. (Location 1168)</p><p>They thus drew a moral line between aggressive and retaliatory violence. But in spite of these honest disagreements, the vast majority were willing to try the experiment. (Location 1176)</p><p>I was the victim of an unwarranted pessimism because I had started out with an unwarranted optimism. (Location 1205)</p><p>I came to see that no one gives up his privileges without strong resistance. (Location 1207)</p><p>Not only was there a conscious attempt to raise questions about the integrity of the Negro leaders, and thereby cause their followers to lose faith in them, there was also an attempt to divide the leaders among themselves. (Location 1225)</p><p>Yoki and Beethoven, she said, kept her company when she was alone. (Location 1242)</p><p>The people are looking to me for leadership, and if I stand before them without strength and courage, they too will falter. (Location 1337)</p><p>Don’t get your weapons. He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword. (Location 1374)</p><p>We must realize so many people are taught to hate us that they are not totally responsible for their hate. (Location 1394)</p><p>Coretta and I talked the matter over for several days and finally agreed that arms were no solution. (Location 1408)</p><p>We tried to satisfy our friends by having floodlights mounted around the house, and hiring unarmed watchmen around the clock. I also promised that I would not travel around the city alone. (Location 1409)</p><p>Had we become distracted by the question of my safety we would have lost the moral offensive and sunk to the level of our oppressors.

Bitterness has not the capacity to make the distinction between some and all. (Location 5171)</p><p>I tried to make it clear that besides opposing violence on principle, I could imagine nothing more impractical and disastrous than for any of us, through misguided judgment, to precipitate a violent confrontation in Mississippi. We had neither the resources nor the techniques to win. (Location 5179)</p><p>Like life, racial understanding is not something that we find but something that we must create.

Justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love. (Location 5301)</p><p>America power is unequally distributed. This has led Negro Americans in the past to seek their goals through love and moral suasion devoid of power and white Americans to seek their goals through power devoid of love and conscience.

I wept for my children and all black children who have been denied a knowledge of their heritage; I wept for all white children, who, through daily miseducation, are taught that the Negro is an irrelevant entity in American society; I wept for all the white parents and teachers who are forced to overlook the fact that the wealth of cultural and technological progress in America is a result of the commonwealth of inpouring contributions.

But when the hopes were blasted, when people came to see that in spite of progress their conditions were still insufferable, when they looked out and saw more poverty, more school segregation, and more slums, despair began to set in. (Location 5369)</p><p>When hope dies, a revolution degenerates into an undiscriminating catchall for evanescent and futile gestures. (Location 5374)</p><p>Sometimes they talk of overthrowing racist state and local governments.

(Location 5570)</p><p>On some positions, Cowardice asks the question, “Is it safe?” Expediency asks the question, “Is it politic?” And Vanity comes along and asks the question, “Is it popular?” But Conscience asks the question, “Is it right?” And there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must do it because Conscience tells him it is right.

Every time you set out to love, something keeps pulling on you, trying to get you to hate.
