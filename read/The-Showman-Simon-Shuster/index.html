(Location 53)</p><p>When the show was over, Zelensky spent nearly an hour with his fans, taking photos with them and accepting their bouquets. (Location 79)</p><p>“Going onstage gives me two emotions,” he once said of these moments. “First comes the fear, and only when you overcome the fear, the pleasure kicks in. That’s what always drew me back out there.” (Location 82)</p><p>No matter how much he might try to resist the metamorphosis, the job would turn him sooner or later into the thing he claimed to despise: a politician. (Location 88)</p><p>our meeting at the Palace of Ukraine opened the door for me to write this one. (Location 111)</p><p>The greatest changes in Zelensky, the ones that became a central focus of this book, took place in the first few months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, (Location 120)</p><p>Stubborn, confident, vengeful, impolitic, brave to the point of recklessness, resistant to pressure, and unsparing toward those who stood in his way, he channeled the anger and resilience of his people and expressed it with clarity and purpose to the world, (Location 122)</p><p>it was the showmanship he honed over more than twenty years as an actor on the stage and a producer in the movie business that made Zelensky so effective in fighting this war— a war that required Ukraine not only to hold the world’s attention but to win the sympathy of people and their governments across the globe. (Location 124)</p><p>His success as a leader in the first hours of the invasion relied on the fact that courage is contagious. (Location 128)</p><p>When it started, he gave the military brass the freedom to lead on the battlefield, while he focused on the dimension of the war where he could be most effective: keeping Ukraine in the headlines, and persuading the world to help. (Location 136)</p><p>Sometimes, in the middle of a story, he would call his bodyguard or one of his aides to check the details. They often remembered things differently. (Location 173)</p><p>Some of them spoke to me during these events or very soon afterward, when the memories were still fresh, and before their stories settled into an accepted narrative of what had happened. (Location 180)</p><p>Fear can protect us. It can also make us run away, and the president’s ability to manage it, to conquer it, has a lot to do with the way Ukraine survived this threat to its existence. (Location 185)</p><a href=#part-i><h3 id=part-i><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part I</h3></a><a href=#chapter-1-daybreak><h4 id=chapter-1-daybreak><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 1 Daybreak</h4></a><p>Zelensky knew that his success in both comedy and politics relied on his ability to play that role, to seem relatable, normal, like one of the guys. (Location 209)</p><p>it had never been his style to worry her. More often he veiled his concerns behind jokes and smiles, then made excuses when she learned what he was hiding. (Location 247)</p><p>Many of those with the luck and foresight to have their bags packed and a tank full of gas tried to leave Kyiv as soon as the explosions started. (Location 259)</p><p>For a millennium and a half, the empires of Europe have fought over this ancient city on the banks of the Dnipro River. The Vikings, Ottomans, Mongols, Lithuanians, and Poles had all laid claim to Kyiv, (Location 264)</p><p>That kind of confidence, even in the face of very long odds, had always been one of Zelensky’s strong suits. (Location 276)</p><p>if you let all that distract you, then your chances of getting where you need to go— to your interim goal, let’s call it that— they are low. Not quite zero, but they are very low.” (Location 289)</p><p>The presidential compound in the center of Kyiv had no such safeguards, but Zelensky insisted on going there first. It is the seat of presidential power, and his message was the same for the senior aides and ministers who called or texted him that morning: GO TO THE OFFICE. I’LL MEET YOU THERE. (Location 296)</p><p>Ukrainians often say rainy weather brings good luck. (Location 311)</p><p>Soviet forces took less than four days in 1956 to occupy the capital of Hungary and overthrow its government, whose leader was then arrested, tortured, found guilty of treason in a secret trial, and, two years later, executed on the gallows. (Location 322)</p><p>For days before the invasion started, Ukraine’s intelligence services had been tracking three groups of assassins tasked with killing Zelensky. (Location 328)</p><p>He refused to believe that in the twenty-first century, three decades after the end of the Cold War, hit men would try to hunt down a sitting European head of state. Nor could he imagine that Putin would start a full-scale war, (Location 334)</p><p>Some of his allies in Europe, including the leaders of France and Germany, assured him that the American predictions of an invasion were overblown. (Location 337)</p><p>Putin’s rise two decades earlier had relied on his victory in a war against Chechnya, a breakaway statelet in southern Russia whose cities he bombed into oblivion in 1999 and 2000, killing tens of thousands of civilians in the process. (Location 353)</p><p>“Before you find yourself in that situation, there is no way to tell how you will react.” (Location 365)</p><p>Early in the Second World War, the leaders of Albania, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Yugoslavia, among others, fled the advance of the German Wehrmacht and lived out the war in exile. (Location 369)</p><p>some had turned off their phones, packed up their cars, and headed toward the western border as soon as the bombing started. (Location 380)</p><p>The worst defections affected Ukraine’s main intelligence agency, known as the SBU. “Especially in the upper and middle ranks, (Location 381)</p><p>The terms of martial law, as laid out in Ukraine’s Constitution, grant the president vast powers to rule by decree, suspending elections and other democratic rights and freedoms of Ukrainians for the duration of the war. Curfews could be imposed, and every man of fighting age, between eighteen and sixty, would be subject to conscription and forbidden from leaving the country. The normal functions of parliament would be put on hold, while the assets of state companies and all private property would be subject to requisition in the interest of national defense. (Location 401)</p><p>He did not want to create the impression that the lawmakers had left their posts, so he told them all to gather in the plenary hall, (Location 409)</p><p>Panic was spreading, and Zelensky understood that it could overtake the capital far more quickly than the Russian tanks. He needed to reassure people that it was safe to stay home, and he made his first attempt at around six thirty a.m. (Location 415)</p><p>The first number he dialed while pacing around his office that morning was that of Boris Johnson, (Location 434)</p><p>“The crux of it was: accept Russia’s demands, or you and your family are dead,” Sybiha told me. Several of the foreign leaders offered to act as mediators for Ukraine to negotiate the terms of its surrender. (Location 444)</p><p>Zelensky felt his only hope, however delusional, was for the West to convince the Kremlin to call off the attack and withdraw its forces. (Location 463)</p><p>Olena gathered the family documents and packed one roller suitcase for herself and the children. All the pets were left in the care of the maid and security guards, (Location 486)</p><p>As long as these staffers asked permission to get their loved ones out of the city, they were allowed to go. “We’re all human beings,” he said. “And some fast decisions had to be made.” (Location 510)</p><p>At Kyiv’s central station, a train stood ready to take them out of the city, their destination a secret even among the president’s closest aides. (Location 520)</p><a href=#chapter-2-the-target><h4 id=chapter-2-the-target><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2 The Target</h4></a><p>Anyone healthy enough to donate blood must offer it at their local hospital. Anyone who wanted an assault rifle, Zelensky said, could go and get one from the distribution points being set up around the city.

(Location 547)</p><p>inspected the place in the months before the invasion, and he made sure the Internet connections had several layers of redundancy. (Location 561)</p><p>“Everyone has their own life and needs to make a decision for themselves,” Zelensky told his aides. “Choose to either stay or go somewhere safer.” (Location 570)</p><p>Russian forces could hijack Ukraine’s judicial system and begin to issue rulings to legitimize their occupation or undermine the president’s authority. To prevent this, Smyrnov and an officer of the security forces rushed to a courthouse in central Kyiv, broke through the door, and ripped the wires out of its computer servers— (Location 601)</p><p>“If we did not give out the weapons,” said Denys Monastyrsky, the minister of internal affairs, “the Russians would have seized them straightaway.” (Location 606)</p><p>As dawn broke on the second day of the invasion, the Armed Forces of Ukraine issued an alert on their Facebook page, informing residents of Kyiv that enemy formations were already in the city. “Make Molotov cocktails,” the statement commanded. “Neutralize the occupiers!” (Location 639)</p><p>Zelensky was adaptable, trained not to lose his nerve under the glare of a massive audience. (Location 643)</p><p>Most of his decisions had no real basis in experience or planning. Zelensky had neither of these things to guide him at the time, but he didn’t seem to mind. (Location 650)</p><p>Zelensky became what one of his aides described as a “decision generator.” (Location 652)</p><p>In attacking Ukraine from multiple directions, they seemed to calculate that the command structure in Kyiv would crack, overwhelmed by the volume of threats that needed an immediate response. (Location 654)</p><p>Some would later backfire in tragic fashion, like the order Zelensky gave to distribute weapons to just about any adult with a Ukrainian passport and a trigger finger. The glut of guns soon turned parts of Kyiv into a shooting gallery. (Location 657)</p><p>“That calmed people down,” says Podolyak. “They stopped thinking and started working.”* (Location 666)</p><p>a swarm of at least thirty Russian attack helicopters swept down over the reservoir north of Kyiv, flying close enough to the water to avoid air defenses. The Ukrainians shot one of the helicopters down on its approach to Hostomel. But the others managed to land a force of several hundred Russian troops, enough to take the airport by storm. (Location 678)</p><p>Once in control of the runways, the Russian commandos prepared for the arrival of reinforcements in giant military transport planes, each one packed with soldiers and armored vehicles. (Location 687)</p><p>No one could summon the force of conscience the moment seemed to require, at least not until Zelensky dialed into the call. (Location 699)</p><p>in real time, they could see the president of a European democracy, holed up in a bunker, preparing to face his own death and the subjugation of his country, all because of the imperial ambitions of his neighbor to the east. (Location 705)</p><a href=#chapter-3-city-of-bandits><h4 id=chapter-3-city-of-bandits><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3 City of Bandits</h4></a><p>She did not want to put her husband in the position of needing to choose between protecting their children and submitting to Russian demands. To avoid that scenario, she knew she would need to accept the security protocols, even if she found many of them suffocating. (Location 749)</p><p>As a child, Zelensky remembers his grandmothers talking in vague terms about the years when Soviet soldiers came to confiscate the food grown in Ukraine, its vast harvests of grain and wheat all carted away at gunpoint. (Location 848)</p><p>Zelensky was a first grader in a Mongolian school, just beginning to pick up the local language, when they traveled home in 1987. (Location 864)</p><p>it was typical of Jewish families in the Soviet Union, who often felt that overachievement was the only way to get a fair shake in a system rigged against them. (Location 874)</p><p>Zelensky’s father, through hard work, managed to overcome these obstacles as he reached the heights of his own profession, and he intended to help his son do the same. (Location 881)</p><p>Zelensky was the product of an era of change. (Location 885)</p><p>By the mid-1990s, the average university and many high schools in the Russian-speaking world had at least one KVN team. (Location 897)</p><p>“It was a rough, working-class place, and you just wanted to escape,” (Location 905)</p><p>half an hour goes by,” Pikalov told me. “Somebody comes over and busts the guitar.” But Zelensky was laughing. He had won the bet. “He said he made it through the third song.” (Location 919)</p><p>he finally got that across to him one night over drinks and a cigarette: “We had a couple shots, and I said, ‘Papa, you have to understand me. I want to be number one in my profession. Looking at you, I will never do better than you can. And being worse than you in your profession is not what I want. You understand? I want to be number one.’ That made Papa sad. You know, men are stingy with their tears. But then he let me go, like a fish from his hands.” (Location 924)</p><p>To make the connection, Pikalov, their mutual friend, borrowed a videocassette from her, a copy of Basic Instinct, and Zelensky used it as an excuse to visit her at home and return the tape. (Location 934)</p><p>for him, “Losing is worse than death.” (Location 943)</p><p>The informal hierarchy, she said, corresponded to Moscow’s vision of itself as an imperial capital. (Location 962)</p><p>Viewed in a generous light, these contests could be seen as a vehicle for Russian soft power in much the same way that American movies defined what good guys and bad guys are supposed to look like for viewers around the world. To be less generous, the league could be construed as a Kremlin-backed program of cultural colonialism. (Location 970)</p><p>With the election of Vladimir Putin in 2000, the Russian state embraced the symbols and icons of its imperial past, and it encouraged its people to stop being ashamed of the Soviet Union. One of Putin’s first acts in office was to change the melody of the Russian national anthem back to the Soviet one.

(Location 1017)</p><p>their aim was to make a version of Saturday Night Live with elements of Monty Python. (Location 1032)</p><p>“That was his main quality as a leader. He’d just say, ‘Let’s do it.’ Then we’d all get scared, and he would just tell us to trust him. (Location 1034)</p><p>Early in his tenure, Putin described the Soviet collapse as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century,” and his plan for rectifying it depended on preserving the bonds between Kyiv and Moscow. (Location 1048)</p><p>Solid majorities in southern and eastern Ukraine backed Russia’s favored candidate, as did the people of Crimea. (Location 1063)</p><p>“We always reacted to political events, but it was based on the people’s point of view,” Olena told me. “We were not political experts. We joked about the things that people talked about in their kitchens.

A lot of that stigma, Zelenska told me, has its roots in the Soviet Union, where generations of Ukrainians were raised to deal with trauma by hiding it away. The attitude, she said, was: “Deal with it, get over it, and if you complain, you’re weak.” (Location 4572)</p><p>To stop the advance of Russian forces from Crimea, the Ukrainians had mined the narrow isthmus that connects Crimea to the mainland.
