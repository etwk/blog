This seems somehow emblematic to me. (In a good way.)” (Location 10)</p><a href=#prologue-sheeple-who-need-sheeple><h3 id=prologue-sheeple-who-need-sheeple><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>PROLOGUE Sheeple Who Need Sheeple</h3></a><p>Apparently, Musk thought that his very presence would turn the fetid water into fine wine, since he had long considered himself more than just a man, but an icon and, on some days, a god. (Location 69)</p><p>When people get really rich, they seem to attract legions of enablers who lick them up and down all day. (Location 91)</p><p>Even though I started out as a reporter, I had shifted into an analyst and sometimes an advocate. (Location 101)</p><p>As much as tech execs wanted visas, they also wanted contracts with the new government, especially the military. They wanted profits repatriated back to the U.S. from foreign countries where they had been stashing their lucre. More than anything, they wanted to be shielded from regulation, which they had neatly and completely avoided so far. (Location 116)</p><p>“Facebook, as well as Twitter and Google’s YouTube and the rest, have become the digital arms dealers of the modern age,” (Location 128)</p><p>French philosopher Paul Virilio has a quote I think about a lot: “When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash; and when you invent electricity, you invent electrocution&mldr;. Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.” (Location 135)</p><p>Today, malevolent actors continue to game the platforms, and there’s still no real solution in sight, because these powerful platforms are doing exactly what they were designed to do. (Location 141)</p><p>The Trump tech summit was a major turning point for me and how I viewed the industry I’d been covering since the early 1990s. The lack of humanity was overwhelming. (Location 157)</p><p>But for tech to fulfill its promise, founders and executives who ran their creations needed to put more safety tools in place. They needed to anticipate consequences more. (Location 162)</p><p>AI’s deep fakes and misinformation open a virtual Pandora’s box, with the potential to unleash troubles to plague humankind faster than any actual plague. (Location 176)</p><p>the “Star Trek” view, where a crew works together to travel to distant worlds like an interstellar Benetton commercial, promoting tolerance and convincing villains not to be villains. (Location 183)</p><p>Innocuous boy-kings who wanted to make the world a better place and ended up cosplaying Darth Vader feels like science fiction. (Location 188)</p><a href=#chapter-1-babylon-was><h3 id=chapter-1-babylon-was><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 1 Babylon Was</h3></a><p>Actual memories faded quickly and all that was left were analog photos. (Location 212)</p><p>The firemen coming to ax the door to splinters, (Location 234)</p><p>I decided to call the paper on my dial-up phone and was so irksome in my desire to correct the record that I managed to get then Metro editor Larry Kramer on the line. (Location 275)</p><p>I was subjected to much propaganda about my own self, as the general public’s understanding of what being gay was like was quite different than the actual experience. (Location 284)</p><p>I didn’t want anyone to be forced into the closet. I wanted them to ask, and I was compelled to tell. (Location 294)</p><p>Despite his obvious editing skills, Shafer was not exactly the mentoring type. I’d been hired for a role I wasn’t qualified for, and I don’t think I did a very good job. (Location 303)</p><p>In those early days, I’d see some of the decisions my bosses made and think, This is how I’d do it. I was beginning to get an inkling of my own tastes and judgment. I just didn’t have the certainty and maturity to act on it. (Location 307)</p><p>I have always, always been like this. It’s hard to neg me. Those who do only encourage me to try to win even more. (Location 311)</p><p>You have to stand up and not be embarrassed or victimized.” It was a value that would never change in me and a characteristic to which I owe a lot of my career. (Location 346)</p><p>with exhausting machinations that were a typically pointless and time-wasting exercise to me. I decided very early to never try to run anything too big. (Location 348)</p><p>Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself”: “Do I contradict myself? / Very well then, I contradict myself. / (I am large, I contain multitudes.)”) (Location 352)</p><p>I decided that was the best way to go through life— not caring about the consequences of saying or doing what I believed was right. (Location 357)</p><p>Reticence and subtlety were definitely not going to be my style, especially when accuracy and honesty were so effective. (Location 364)</p><p>In years to come, I would not miss those opportunities. Life is far too short, as I had learned at five years old. I did not have the time to waste. (Location 369)</p><a href=#chapter-2-before-the-gold-rush><h3 id=chapter-2-before-the-gold-rush><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 2 Before the Gold Rush</h3></a><p>Everything that can be digitized will be digitized. (Location 401)</p><p>I was riveted by that part, of total domination followed by utter collapse. (Location 429)</p><p>Discovery Communications, which was located in the D.C. area, had spent $ 10 million to&mldr; build a web site. (Location 437)</p><p>How much I loved these owners, I cannot underscore enough, for their bravery and steadfastness and decency and, really, their commitment to excellence in a less-than-excellent world. Don Graham was also inexplicably humble and even sheepish about his power. (Location 458)</p><p>in 1988 when the Library of Congress announced they would add software to their collection. (Location 490)</p><p>the Netscape browser completely dominated the market, becoming the first Web company to make a fortune. (Location 523)</p><p>this extravagant assertion— which he jokingly denies today— seemed like classic product hype. (Location 533)</p><p>As futurist Jaron Lanier would later tell me— the biggest experiment in human community also turned out to be the most disastrous. (Location 540)</p><p>I hated their entitlement and certainty that the future belonged to them. (Location 561)</p><p>Walt and I instantly became close, bound by professional kismet and a tech mind meld. (Location 579)</p><a href=#chapter-3-california-here-i-came><h3 id=chapter-3-california-here-i-came><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 3 California, Here I Came</h3></a><p>Walt chose to live in D.C., far away from Silicon Valley, in order to maintain the distance needed to judge the products fairly. (Location 594)</p><p>“Parachute in with your cleats on,” he said. “They’ll never know what hit them. Be fair but cover them hard since they’re going to run the world.” (Location 607)</p><p>I was intrigued by the sight of so many people living their lives out loud, presumably proud, in ways that no one back East seemed able to for very long or with any energy. (Location 615)</p><p>He was in his mid-twenties but seemed more like he was eleven or twelve years old. At the time, he struggled to clock social cues easily and never tried hard with social niceties. And he would often see disagreements as an attack rather than an opening to learn something. (Location 639)</p><p>the Netscape campus in Mountain View was an adult version of a kindergarten. There was prepared food at all hours, games of all sorts, beanbag-style chairs, and fleece hoodies. (Location 658)</p><p>rather than lying to me, these entrepreneurs were more often lying to themselves. Maybe they felt it was necessary in order to suspend reality and create a new industry out of nothing. Thomas Edison did this constantly, (Location 668)</p><p>Tech is littered with men whose parents— typically fathers— were either cruel or absent. By the time they grew to be adults, many were unhappy and often had some disgruntled tale of being misunderstood before they were proved triumphantly right. (Location 671)</p><p>this declaration leaves out a lot about who’s responsible when things go terribly awry and real people get hurt. (Location 679)</p><p>Originally called “Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web,” which was created in 1994, as the portal grew popular, it was renamed Yahoo, an acronym for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.” (Location 692)</p><p>Much of it, of course, was performative, signaling to the public that these inventors were going to seize power and have a good time doing it. (Location 713)</p><p>But tech took it one step further, aiming for childlike and then veering into childish pretty quickly. (Location 733)</p><p>Once companies like Yahoo and Netscape instituted these silly environments, everyone copied them, and their indulgent VC parents went along for the ride. (Location 734)</p><p>Few tech leaders had learned the most potent lesson of the sector yet: The young inevitably eat the old. (Location 735)</p><p>I maintained that part of my job was to make that stink and write about where it could all go wrong. (Location 748)</p><p>The rules of the bubble are different, until it pops. (Location 764)</p><a href=#chapter-4-search-me><h3 id=chapter-4-search-me><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 4 Search Me</h3></a><p>Over the years, they’d imagine a lot, from putting ski lifts on the hills of San Francisco to help citizens get around, to building giant windmills in Hawaii to produce energy for cars that hovered. (Location 836)</p><p>Another smart move that only a few companies made at the time was to bring in professional management. In 2001, Google recruited well-known tech leader Eric Schmidt to essentially be the adult in the room. A former Sun Microsystems executive, (Location 850)</p><p>Google did it right from the start, employing a simple but jaunty brand, intuitive usability, and total efficacy. (Location 858)</p><p>But it was a big deal when Yahoo selected Google to be its default search provider in mid-2000, to add to its directory and navigational guide. (Location 867)</p><p>He looked at me dead in the eyes and added: “But don’t tell them.” Of course, that’s the first thing that I did. (Location 877)</p><p>Yang laughed at me, as he often did. He told me Yahoo was making a ton of money with the additional search for the small fee that it paid for Google’s services. (Location 881)</p><p>Inktomi had made its business selling its unbranded search technology to Amazon, Microsoft’s MSN, and eBay, but it was still struggling against the Google onslaught. (Location 892)</p><p>Google was becoming a Borg that would suck in all the world’s information and then spit it out for profit. (Location 904)</p><p>In late summer 2003, for example, Page, Wojcicki, and my then wife, Megan Smith, flew to New York to meet with the major publishing houses about Google’s plan to scan all the world’s books, starting with those out of print. (Location 905)</p><p>He and many at the company were relentless about the idea that all information needed to be vacuumed up and sorted by the Googlers to bring illumination to the human race and distribution to all. (Location 914)</p><p>At that moment he was sorting through how to go public with some modicum of integrity, (Location 926)</p><p>Google would later go public via an unusual “Dutch auction” that involved collecting bids from interested investors to determine the highest price at which it could sell its shares. (Location 927)</p><p>he and others at Google insisted on establishing a set of corporate values that the company could adhere to as it headed into the stratosphere. (Location 934)</p><p>Google was a place where personal and professional mixed a lot. At one point early on, it felt like everyone there was dating someone else there, a situation that would become a problem later. (Location 944)</p><p>as my spouse got higher jobs at Google, I had to insert links to long disclosures on my stories. Eventually, I stopped reporting on Google altogether. (Location 947)</p><p>I also thought the whole idea of “Don’t Be Evil” was both arrogant and naïve. (Location 948)</p><p>“I’m worried about the bad people later.” You know, the evil ones. Since, unlike the people I covered, I had studied history and I had zero doubt they would show up soon enough. (Location 972)</p><a href=#chapter-5-the-mongoose><h3 id=chapter-5-the-mongoose><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 5 The Mongoose</h3></a><p>Tech leaders loved to dole out these origin tidbits for color, and the often-hungry media ate them up with gusto. (Location 997)</p><p>at the time, there was no one more performative than Bezos. (Location 1000)</p><p>Unlike the Google founders, who were born in the 1970s, Bezos was born in the 1960s and wasn’t an engineer by nature, so he approached the problem of Web commerce in an analytical way. (Location 1003)</p><p>To Bezos, everything was dedicated to the higher purpose of pushing Amazon forward. This would manifest in a tougher work culture than the coddled tech playpens of Silicon Valley. (Location 1007)</p><p>If Page and Brin were whimsical brainiacs, Bezos personified muscular ambition. (Location 1030)</p><p>Yet Bezos succeeded, carefully adding feature after feature after getting the first thing right. (Location 1045)</p><p>Since Bezos was not as deeply insecure as many tech types, even if he was just as narcissistic, he had no problem cutting ties with anyone he did not need once the momentum got going. (Location 1063)</p><p>With purchases of goods moving online, customers needed a better way to pay for them, and several tech companies popped up to respond to that need, including PayPal, which was founded in 1998, and its rival X.com, an online bank. (Location 1096)</p><p>It was impossible for me not to say what I thought, which made me a bad employee. (Location 1113)</p><p>What I did not foresee, even though every other column I wrote seemed to have the word “frothy” in it, was that it was always lightest before the dark. In the two years between the turn of the century and 2002, almost eight hundred Internet companies went belly-up as the so-called “dotcom bubble” burst.

(Location 1191)</p><p>AOL was an earlier Facebook, all about getting together, being together, delivering news. (Location 1195)</p><p>I have always maintained that the people who ultimately succeed are the creative ones. (Location 1196)</p><p>repercussions rippled through the entire tech ecosystem as startup after startup closed down, stocks of tech companies limped, (Location 1219)</p><p>The AOL − Time Warner deal was indeed a kind of Internet Rubicon: It stopped the stupid boom that needed stopping and ushered the nascent industry into maturity with a rough shove.

(Location 1357)</p><p>Jobs was what passed for a cool kid in Silicon Valley terms, while Gates was a geek’s geek. (Location 1366)</p><p>Walt approached Jobs first, knowing that Gates would jump at the chance, while Jobs would play hard to get. (Location 1369)</p><p>While Gates had always been overly aggressive in business and pushed Microsoft in ways that would attract much-deserved scrutiny, one of his most enduring characteristics was a deep love of learning. (Location 1400)</p><p>Jobs almost never lost the idea that this was a very short life and that eternity was very long. (Location 1405)</p><p>“I think of most things in life as either a Bob Dylan or Beatles song,” Jobs said in perhaps one of the more wistful moments I ever saw him in. “And there’s that one line in a Beatles song, ‘You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.’ ” He paused for exactly the right amount of time, the consummate performer, and then added: “And that’s clearly true here.” He gestured to Gates with a little wave. (Location 1412)</p><p>But after a few back-and-forths, Jobs said, “You’re probably right.” He acknowledged that Apple was following in the social space and not leading, a fact he hated as much as he hated Facebook and Myspace. (Location 1429)</p><p>Some tech innovators focus on the product and others focus on the consumer. (Location 1435)</p><p>It sucks when people settle for an uninspiring product. Facebook comes to mind. These companies tend to see themselves as utilities. (Location 1437)</p><p>Of all the ideas Jobs touted, mobility and wireless were the most significant. (Location 1440)</p><p>While many have argued that other companies, from Samsung to Microsoft to Nokia, could have made this critical mobile leap to app-driven smartphones with multi-touch screens and a real web browser, no company had the combination of personality, design sense, and pure pushiness that would make Apple the dominant global hub technology. (Location 1465)</p><p>“The best ideas have to win,” Jobs insisted over and over to me. He utterly rejected the idea of speed (move fast) and destruction (break things). He believed in working for as long as you needed to get the design and technology right, which was one of Apple’s persistent characteristics. (Location 1473)</p><p>“One of the huge challenges particularly amongst large groups is that when you’re talking about an idea, often the thing that is easiest to talk about— that is measurable, that’s tangible— are the problems,” Ive said. “And he was masterful at keeping people focused on the actual vision of the idea. He had a wonderful reverence for the creative process.” (Location 1476)</p><p>Jobs was also deeply interested in newspapers, music, books, and more. (Location 1480)</p><p>unlike most CEOs in Silicon Valley, he contemplated the impact of technology and new media on society. (Location 1485)</p><p>News gathering and editorials are important.

(Location 1498)</p><p>over those critical years— perhaps the most productive of his life— Jobs was dying. (Location 1504)</p><p>“And I thought deeply about this and I ended up concluding that the worst thing that could possibly happen as we get big and we get a little more influence in the world is if we change our core values and start letting it slide. I can’t do that. I’d rather quit.” (Location 1514)</p><p>“Let’s stop looking backward,” Jobs declared. “It’s all about what happens tomorrow. Let’s go invent tomorrow.” (Location 1533)</p><p>My take: As an entrepreneur, Jobs was too passionate, which led him to push hard— and sometimes too hard— on what he believed in.

(Location 1870)</p><p>Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who was prone to rocking when you talked to him, a tic he seemed to later overcome. Gates had worked hard to smooth the edges, like many entrepreneurs as they gained wealth and power, getting better clothes, better haircuts, better bodies. (Location 1873)</p><p>He had a quality I actually liked: He did not hide his bottomless ambition as other smoother young entrepreneurs did. (Location 1890)</p><p>Worst of all, they were different in ways that made no difference. They’d insist that they wanted to “change the world” and “it was all about the journey” and “money was not the goal.” Those were all lies, of course, made more problematic by the fact that these men were lying to themselves most of all. (Location 1893)</p><p>Despite those peculiar caveats, Zuckerberg seemed to land on the side of Augustus Caesar and the belief that an emperor’s gotta do what an emperor’s gotta do. (Location 1908)</p><p>Osnos summed up Zuckerberg’s attitude perfectly, noting, “Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale.” (Location 1909)</p><p>The aim was to “break things” instead of “change things” or “fix things” or “improve things.” (Location 1913)</p><p>Thanks to Facebook’s intentional corporate structure, he controls the voting shares and the board and can never be expunged in any kind of democratic way for bad management. Let me break it down more simply: Mark. Cannot. Be. Fired. Ever. Neither can his progeny. He is an absolute emperor. (Location 1922)</p><p>his dream is to connect the world, no matter the cost.

Because almost everything— all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure— these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
