Later they took part in the campaigns of Alexander the Great. (Location 66)</p><p>During World War II the world was witness to a women’s phenomenon. (Location 76)</p><p>Millions of the cheaply killed Have trod the path in darkness&mldr; —OSIP MANDELSTAM (Location 88)</p><p>my Ukrainian grandfather, my mother’s father, was killed at the front and is buried somewhere in Hungary, (Location 99)</p><p>The Germans burned alive eleven distant relations with their children— some in their cottage, some in a village church. (Location 102)</p><p>At school we were taught to love death. We wrote compositions about how we would like to die in the name of&mldr; We dreamed&mldr; (Location 113)</p><p>For a long time I was a bookish person, both frightened and attracted by reality. My fearlessness came from an ignorance of life. (Location 115)</p><p>I searched for a long time&mldr; What words can convey what I hear? I searched for a genre that would correspond to how I see the world, how my eye, my ear, are organized. (Location 117)</p><p>Everything we know about war we know with “a man’s voice.” We are all captives of “men’s” notions and “men’s” sense of war. “Men’s” words. Women are silent. (Location 126)</p><p>If they suddenly begin to remember, they don’t talk about the “women’s” war but about the “men’s.” They tune in to the canon. And only at home or waxing tearful among their combat girlfriends do they begin to talk about their war, (Location 128)</p><p>There are no heroes and incredible feats, there are simply people who are busy doing inhumanly human things. And it is not only they (people!) who suffer, but the earth, the birds, the trees. All that lives on earth with us. They suffer without words, (Location 134)</p><p>Remembering is not a passionate or dispassionate retelling of a reality that is no more, but a new birth of the past, when time goes in reverse. (Location 146)</p><p>The feelings and language of educated people, strange as it may be, are often more subject to the working of time. Its general encrypting. They are infected by secondary knowledge. By myths. (Location 151)</p><p>After a certain time, you never know when or why, suddenly comes this long-awaited moment, when the person departs from the canon— plaster and reinforced concrete, like our monuments— and goes on to herself. Into herself. (Location 156)</p><p>We know how to suffer and how to tell about our suffering. Suffering justifies our hard and ungainly life. For us pain is art. I must admit, women boldly set out on this path&mldr; (Location 162)</p><p>Calmly and as equals. Without joy and amazement, which are the gifts of the meeting between youth and age. (Location 165)</p><p>After long years a person understands that this was life, but now it’s time to resign yourself and get ready to go. (Location 170)</p><p>In the midst of all this— married? In the midst of black soot and black bricks&mldr; Look at me&mldr; Look how I am! Begin by making me a woman: give me flowers, court me, say beautiful words. (Location 180)</p><p>To ask Dostoevsky’s question: How much human being is in a human being, and how to protect this human being in oneself? (Location 189)</p><p>What are we looking for? Most often not great deeds and heroism, but small, human things, the most interesting and intimate for us. (Location 201)</p><p>It is precisely there, in the warm human voice, in the living reflection of the past, that the primordial joy is concealed and the insurmountable tragedy of life is laid bare. Its chaos and passion. Its uniqueness and inscrutability. Not yet subjected to any treatment. The originals. (Location 215)</p><p>We like war less and less; it’s more and more difficult to find a justification for it. For us it’s simply murder. At least it is for me. (Location 233)</p><p>I would like to write a book about war that would make war sickening, and the very thought of it repulsive. Insane. So that even the generals would be sickened&mldr; (Location 234)</p><p>“women’s” war is more terrible than “men’s.” Men hide behind history, behind facts; war fascinates them as action and a conflict of ideas, of interests, whereas women are caught up with feelings. (Location 239)</p><p>They are capable of seeing what is closed to men. I repeat once more: their war has smell, has color, a detailed world of existence: (Location 242)</p><p>And how much more unbearable and unthinkable it is to kill, because a woman gives life. Gives it. Bears it in herself for a long time, nurses it. (Location 251)</p><p>Yes, they cry a lot. They shout. Swallow heart pills after I am gone. Call an ambulance. But even so they beg me: “Come. Be sure to come. We’ve been silent so long. Forty years&mldr;” (Location 267)</p><p>I LISTEN TO THE pain&mldr; Pain as the proof of past life. There are no other proofs, I don’t trust other proofs. Words have more than once led us away from the truth. (Location 277)</p><p>&mldr;our memory is far from an ideal instrument. It is not only arbitrary and capricious, it is also chained to time, like a dog. (Location 291)</p><p>she saved herself by stealing horse dung at the kolkhoz* 7 stable by night and eating it. Nobody could eat it, but she did: “When it’s warm it’s disgusting, but you can eat it cold. Frozen is the best, it smells of hay.” (Location 305)</p><p>They are still paralyzed not only by Stalin’s hypnosis and fear, but also by their former faith. (Location 312)</p><p>a great idea needs a small human being, not a great one. A great one is superfluous and inconvenient for it. Hard to process. (Location 324)</p><p>the history of the war had been replaced by the history of the victory. (Location 326)</p><p>We still did not know (or else forgot) that revolution is always an illusion, especially in our history. (Location 336)</p><p>What wounds us most of all is that we have been driven from a great past into an unbearably small present. (Location 358)</p><p>—Our heroism is sterile, it leaves no room for physiology or biology. It’s not believable. War tested not only the spirit but the body, too. The material shell. (Location 399)</p><p>we were saved by the swamps where the punitive forces didn’t go. A quagmire. It sucked in equipment and people for good. For days, for weeks, we stood up to our necks in water. (Location 404)</p><p>precisely at the moment when the rats disappeared from sight, the bombing began. (Location 423)</p><p>The only thing we were afraid of was that our own girls would find out about it. Our nurses. (Location 436)</p><p>—True, I don’t love great ideas. I love the little human being&mldr; (Location 458)</p><p>People turned against each other. The children of the kulaks* 11 came back from exile. Their parents had been killed, and they served the German forces. They took their revenge. (Location 481)</p><p>At first the Germans disbanded the kolkhozes and gave people the land. People breathed more freely after Stalin. We paid quitrent&mldr; Paid it accurately&mldr; And then they began to burn us. (Location 484)</p><p>Aie, daughter dear, I’m afraid of words. Words are scary&mldr; I saved myself by doing good, I didn’t wish evil on anyone. I pitied them all&mldr; (Location 486)</p><p>—After the war&mldr; Human life was worthless. (Location 506)</p><p>We dug&mldr; Whatever we found and recognized we took. One brought an arm in a wheelbarrow, another a head in a cart&mldr; (Location 515)</p><p>It’s a pity my mother didn’t live to get this news. She died branded as the wife of an enemy of the people. A traitor. There were many like her. (Location 525)</p><p>We thought that after the war everything would change&mldr; Stalin would trust his people. But the war was not yet over, and the troop trains were already going to Magadan.* 14 Troop trains with the victors&mldr; Those who had been captured, those who had survived the German camps, those whom the Germans had taken along to work for them— all those who had seen Europe— were arrested. Those who could tell how people there lived. (Location 528)</p><p>After the Victory everybody became silent. Silent and afraid, as before the war&mldr; (Location 532)</p><p>Within my memory the history textbook has been rewritten three times. (Location 534)</p><p>for a long time I did not believe that our Victory had two faces— one beautiful and the other terrible, all scars— unbearable to look at. (Location 542)</p><p>The novel I Am from a Burning Village (also known in English as Out of the Fire), by the Belorussian writers Ales Adamovich (1927– 1994), Yanka Bryl (1917– 2006), and Vladimir Kolesnik (1922– 1994), (Location 550)</p><p>Gulag is the Russian acronym for “Main Administration of Camps,” (Location 554)</p><p>In Soviet legal terminology the phrase “without the right of correspondence” usually meant the prisoner had been executed. (Location 556)</p><p>Golodomor (“ holodomor” in Ukrainian) means “death by hunger.” The term refers to the deliberately created famine of 1932– 1933 in Ukraine, which cost many millions of lives. (Location 558)</p><p>why this absence in us of surprise in the face of evil? (Location 586)</p><p>I only remember what happened to me. My own war. There were lots of people around, but you were always alone, because a human being is always alone in the face of death. (Location 603)</p><p>Sometimes a messenger came in the middle of the night, gave them two hours to get ready, and they’d be carted off. They could even be taken right from the fields. (Location 617)</p><p>There were young people from all over the country, many of whom had been under occupation, spoiling to be revenged for the death of their near ones. From all over the Soviet Union. (Location 632)</p><p>We learned to assemble and disassemble a sniper’s rifle with our eyes shut, to determine wind speed, the movement of the target, the distance to the target, to dig a foxhole, to crawl on our stomach (Location 649)</p><p>The colonel came, walked around looking at the clearing, then stepped on a hummock— saw nothing. Then the “hummock” under him begged: (Location 665)</p><p>suddenly a thought flashed through my mind: he’s a human being; he may be an enemy, but he’s a human being— and my hands began to tremble, I started trembling all over, I got chills. Some sort of fear&mldr; That feeling sometimes comes back to me in dreams even now&mldr; (Location 678)</p><p>&mldr;I came back from the war gray-haired. Twenty-one years old, but my hair was completely white. I had been badly wounded, had a concussion, poor hearing in one ear. (Location 699)</p><p>Mama would catch me, press me to her, and talk to me: “Wake up, wake up. The war is over. You’re home.” I would come to my senses at her words: “I’m your mama. Mama&mldr;” She spoke softly. Softly&mldr; Loud talk frightened me&mldr; (Location 706)</p><p>We started out at daybreak and came back from the front line when it got dark. For twelve hours or more we lay in the snow or climbed to the top of a tree, onto the roof of a shed or a ruined house, and there camouflaged ourselves, (Location 722)</p><p>my girls sat and didn’t touch the supper. I understood what it was about, burst into tears, and ran out of the dugout&mldr; The girls ran after me, started comforting me. Then quickly grabbed their pots and began to eat&mldr; (Location 746)</p><p>I looked at skirts with horror&mldr; at dresses&mldr; We didn’t wear skirts at the front, only trousers. We used to wash them in the evening and sleep on them— that counted as ironing. (Location 777)</p><p>Can they make a color film about war? Everything was black. Only the blood was another color, the blood was red&mldr; (Location 785)</p><p>All those years she had been traveling from one invalid home to another, from one hospital to another, undergoing dozens of surgeries. She didn’t even tell her mother she was alive&mldr; She hid from everybody&mldr; (Location 794)</p><p>Even if you come home alive, your soul will hurt. Now I think: it would be better to be wounded in an arm or a leg. Then my body would hurt, not my soul&mldr; (Location 800)</p><p>I gather what I would call knowledge of the spirit. I follow the traces of inner life; I make records of the soul. For me the path of a soul is more important than the event itself. (Location 818)</p><p>The first year, when I came back from the war, I talked and talked. Nobody listened. So I shut up&mldr; (Location 835)</p><p>Before the war there were rumors that Hitler was preparing to attack the Soviet Union, but such talk was strictly forbidden. (Location 852)</p><p>But after Stalin’s speech mama said: “We’ll defend the Motherland and sort it out later.” Everybody loved the Motherland. (Location 859)</p><p>one of our soldiers rush at a German tank with his rifle and beat the armor with the rifle butt. He beat, and shouted, and wept till he fell. Till a German submachine gun shot him. During the first year we fought with rifles against tanks and “Messers”&mldr;* (Location 891)</p><p>we reckoned three months was also long. But the program there was just about to end. We asked to be allowed to take the exams. There was one month of studies left. At night we got practical training in the hospitals, and during the day we studied. (Location 921)</p><p>there were trains passing by one after another with nothing but girls in them. They were singing. They waved to us— some with scarves, some with forage caps. (Location 947)</p><p>Mama wrote a prayer for me. I put it into a locket; maybe it helped— I did come back home. Before combat I used to kiss that locket&mldr; (Location 949)</p><p>my father thought that metallurgy was a woman’s work, and piloting wasn’t. The director of the flying club learned about it and allowed me to take my father for a flight in a plane. So I did. My father and I went up in the air together, and after that day he kept mum. He liked it. (Location 955)</p><p>there probably will never again be such people as we were then. Never! So naïve and so sincere. With such faith! (Location 998)</p><p>I started serving supper and fell down. They brought me back to consciousness and all I heard was: “Quick! Hurry!” And again—“ Quick! Hurry!” A few days later they were still taking blood from me for the badly wounded. People were dying&mldr; (Location 1019)</p><p>Now I live in Crimea&mldr; Here everything drowns in flowers, and every day I look out the window at the sea, but I’m worn out with pain, I still don’t have a woman’s face. I cry often, I moan all day. It’s my memories&mldr; (Location 1028)</p><p>It took me eight hours to drag him back, tied with a belt by the hand. He was alive when we finally made it.

The war is over, you could go back home, but you go to defend your Motherland.” (Location 3075)</p><p>A human wave carried us out onto the platform. Having turned into a pair of icicles, we were unable to move. We stood, supporting each other so as not to fall down, not to break into smithereens, as a frog did once in front of my eyes, taken out of liquid oxygen and thrown on the floor.

Before the war young people in flying clubs learned to fly in them, but no one could have imagined they would have any military use. The plane was constructed entirely of plywood, covered with aircraft fabric. In fact, with cheesecloth. One direct hit and it caught fire and burned up completely in the air, before reaching the ground. Like a match. The only solid metal part was the M-11 motor.

I wasn’t used to being embraced. I was used to being responsible for myself. I waited for tender words, but I didn’t understand them. To me they seemed childish.

All the swaddling clothes got wet. We ran out of the village with the children; we ran for another three miles. Other women also ran along. My children were falling down, and I was barely able to carry the little one. And Volodya, that’s my husband, turned to look, and I kept running.
