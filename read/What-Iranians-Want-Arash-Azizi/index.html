This is a revolution.’ (Location 25)</p><p>The last significant wave of protests, at the tail-end of 2019, became notorious as ‘Bloody November’ – a title earned in the deaths of over a thousand protesters.

(Location 34)</p><p>The slogan ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ unifies all these issues – transforming demands into a programme. (Location 52)</p><p>Hal Draper, an American revolutionary, once wrote ‘Nothing can be guaranteed, of course, except the honour and dignity of fighting for a new and better world, rather than the vileness of adapting one’s mind and heart to a vile one.’ (Location 58)</p><a href=#one-freedom-is-global-the-fight-against-compulsory-hijab><h3 id=one-freedom-is-global-the-fight-against-compulsory-hijab><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>One Freedom is Global: The Fight Against Compulsory Hijab</h3></a><p>an ordinary Iranian woman. When outside, she wore long, loose, dark cloaks, with a bit of hair jutting out of the mandatory veil. Inside, she wore colourful, embroidered dresses, dancing to Kurdish music and Persian divas alike. (Location 84)</p><p>Following an ancient Iranian tradition, women cut their hair to signal mourning. Many around the world imitated the gesture in solidarity. (Location 91)</p><p>By the time of Mahsa’s state murder, Iranian women had had to endure more than four decades of compulsory veiling. This policy, which forces women to cover all their body except for the face and the palm of their hands, doesn’t have parallels anywhere in the world, Muslim or otherwise. (Location 98)</p><p>Whatever their religious preferences, the women of 1979 enjoyed the progressive changes brought about by the tireless work of Iranian feminists in the preceding decades. (Location 120)</p><p>On 23 January 1979, as the Grand Ayatollah whiled away the last days of his Parisian exile, he did something he had never done before: he gave an interview to a female reporter. (Location 133)</p><p>‘A man full of spite and hate is coming to rule over us,’ she said. But her warnings fell on deaf ears. There was just no end to the wild clamouring for Khomeini. (Location 155)</p><p>In the months leading to his triumphant return to Iran, Khomeini had cynically adopted the language of human rights and freedom to win over clueless Western observers. (Location 179)</p><p>‘We didn’t make a revolution to go back in time,’ they said. ‘We will fight for freedom,’ (Location 212)</p><p>Many prominent woman intellectuals agreed. Daneshvar said: ‘We should first take care of the economy, get our agriculture to some level, bring about a government of justice and freedom&mldr; and we can then get to side issues&mldr; such as woman’s attire.’ (Location 279)</p><p>The regime’s retreat had been temporary, a momentary pause that allowed it to gather its forces. As the Islamic Republic was formally declared in April 1979, it soon showed that it had no intention of allowing women to wear what they liked. (Location 286)</p><p>In 1983, the Iranian parliament, dominated by pro-Khomeini MPs, passed an Islamic penal code that brought about some of the strictest interpretation of Islamic rule in the modern era. (Location 307)</p><p>Within a matter of years, all non-Khomeinist forces, whether Islamist or secular, whether left-wing or right-wing, were suppressed. Tens of thousands of their supporters were executed in the dark decade of the 1980s. (Location 313)</p><p>Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in September 1980 and an eight-year war ensued. At home, the repression only increased. (Location 316)</p><p>someone who tells you what to wear will soon also tell you what to think. (Location 322)</p><p>Over the years new generations of Iranian feminists came to agitate and organise for a variety of rights. Many considered the compulsory Hijab to be a lost cause and they focused on other terrains of struggle. (Location 339)</p><p>She thought of many moments like this; little moments of courage when women dared to do something small that could cost them big time: a ride or a walk without the perennial scarf, a secret kiss in the corner of a park. She called this a moment of Azaadi-haaye Yavashaki (Location 357)</p><p>The Facebook page Masih had built soon received thousands of pictures and videos sent by women who wanted to flaunt their disregard for the rules of the Islamic Republic. Some blurred their faces but many didn’t, displaying awe-inspiring courage. (Location 361)</p><p>In 2017, she launched the White Wednesdays campaign, asking women to wear white scarves on Wednesdays as a protest against the regime. Once more, thousands answered her call. (Location 376)</p><p>They became known as the Girls of Enqelab Avenue. By their act of protest, Vida and her comrades were reclaiming not just the street but the revolution. (Location 384)</p><p>these simple acts of female resistance amounted to what sociologist Assef Bayat had long ago termed ‘Life as Politics’.

(Location 444)</p><p>Fariba had been barred from university education as she belonged to a religion not officially recognised by the regime. Yet she had studied in the clandestine Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE), founded in 1989. This institute’s classes took place in believers’ living rooms to avoid detection. (Location 451)</p><p>‘People have come to believe that their survival is in contradiction with the survival of the regime,’ Bahare said. ‘The movement for Women, Life, Freedom has now given us positive slogans. Previously, we had negative slogans against the regime but we didn’t have a slogan that could have general acceptance. Now we have hopeful slogans. This movement is not divided. (Location 473)</p><p>While women’s magazines and publishing houses acted like virtual organisers for feminists, women-owned bookstores became physical spaces that emerged as a new public square. (Location 517)</p><p>the most significant campaign of feminists pursuing their aims in civil society in conjunction with the Khatami administration came around a shared demand: for Iran to accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). (Location 564)</p><p>the Expediency Council, a body (also entirely appointed by the Supreme Leader) that was meant to conciliate between the parliament and the Guardian Council. (Location 580)</p><p>in autumn 2003, another important milestone came for the struggle of Iranian women. Shirin Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. ‘For her efforts for democracy and human rights&mldr; especially the struggle for rights of women and children.’ (Location 611)</p><p>in the afternoon of 8 March 2004, as women started to gather for the historic event, they were told by the security forces that the interior ministry had annulled the permit at 11 a.m. that very morning. The Khatami administration had stabbed the movement in the back. (Location 625)</p><p>Soon, there would be at least five hundred women who encircled the police forces. Many women had come with their husbands and small children. Police had tried to isolate the women but now they themselves were under siege. (Location 631)</p><p>They sang ‘Oh Iran’, an unofficial national anthem steeped in Iranian patriotism and which provides an alternative to the regime’s dour official anthem. They sang ‘My Schoolmate’, a revolutionary song that promised solidarity against tyranny. (Location 635)</p><p>If the Khatami administration had been non-cooperative, the new administration was positively hostile to women’s rights and other civil society campaigns. (Location 670)</p><p>Gathering petition signatures had long been a staple of activist practice but what distinguished this campaign was its vast grassroots and participatory model. Feminist activists went all over the country to hold meetings that would educate interested volunteers on discriminatory provisions in Iranian law. Activists and volunteers would then be dispatched to the public, especially women, to explain their rights to them and agitate for change.

(Location 725)</p><p>none other than the oil workers had administered the coup de grace on the Shah’s regime in 1979. (Location 731)</p><p>On the coast of the Persian Gulf, Mahshahr oil workers were joined by other contract workers in the industry participating in the three-day strike. (Location 767)</p><p>No one was surprised that the strike had some of its strongest turnouts in Kurdistan. Kurds are more politically organised and more to the left than most other Iranians; the decade after the 1979 revolution was marked by armed struggle by far left groups in Iranian Kurdistan. (Location 769)</p><p>In the big cities like Tehran, even some upmarket pizzerias and shoe stores showed solidarity in their own way: they remained nominally open but silently asked customers to not buy anything. (Location 775)</p><p>The last day of the strike, 7 December, coincided with the Students Day, commemorating the three left-wing students who were killed by the army in 1953 when they came out to protest an impending visit to Tehran by then Vice President Richard Nixon. (Location 782)</p><p>As the regime’s various factions – reformists, centrists and conservatives – had fought ferociously for years, none of them had given much support to trade unions or prioritised their campaigns. (Location 794)</p><p>Many of those who advocated socially or politically liberal policies fiercely opposed trade union struggles against privatisations, ‘rationalisations’ and other ‘structural adjustments’, i.e. the neoliberal playbook. (Location 796)</p><p>The lack of a powerful nationwide trade union movement, combined with affluent progressives’ incomprehension, relegated trade unions to the margins of popular political consciousness and prevented further growth. (Location 802)</p><p>independent trade unions lagged behind and lacked advocates among the reformists within the regime. These reformists controlled the state-controlled unions (called the House of Labour) and had no intention of tolerating a challenge from rank-and-file workers in the industrial sphere. (Location 822)</p><p>The Bus Workers Union benefitted from the charisma of its leader, Mansoor Osanloo, who had worked as a bus driver since 1984. He came from a trade unionist family: (Location 838)</p><p>The classes weren’t simply educational, they were a foundation for future organising. (Location 853)</p><p>If middle-class activists liked to quote Gandhi, Osanloo invoked the long traditions of Islamic socialism by quoting Ali, the first Shia Imam. ‘It is Ali who said that when poverty enters the house, faith leaves! We don’t need to be poor. Our country is rich, let’s unite and fight for our rights.’ (Location 864)</p><p>Teachers in five major provinces came together to form a new Coordinating Council and organised a demonstration of more than 6,000 teachers outside parliament in early 2007. (Location 895)</p><p>The new union movement also produced a vibrant cultural renaissance. Events hosted by the metalworkers’ union screened left-wing films appealing to ordinary workers. Favourites included Stanley Kubrick’s 1960 epic Spartacus with its themes of slave revolt and charismatic leadership; (Location 907)</p><p>for-profit health care – long the norm in the US but also increasingly promoted in Iran. (Location 910)</p><p>In 1999, the finance ministry shocked the workers by annulling its purchase contract. Iran now relied on cheap imported sugar. Later, it turned out that this move had benefitted politically connected businessmen (Location 937)</p><p>Iranians had voted in droves for Rouhani, chiefly for his promise of reaching a diplomatic reconciliation with the United States that could help ease the sanctions on Iran. When that deal was reached in 2015, following months of intense negotiations in Muscat, Geneva, Lausanne and Vienna, the Iranian economy had a shot at doing better. But hopes were dashed a year later, when Donald Trump was elected president (Location 971)</p><p>In one of this better-known speeches from November 2018, Bakhshi broke into tears as he said: ‘Four workers set themselves of fire. For the want of 12 million rials. Damn this life’. (Location 980)</p><p>‘Here, right here, we the workers ourselves decide our own fate and our own demands. We issue our commands from below. We’ve had enough of being struck on the head from the above.’ (Location 985)</p><p>Soon after the TV documentary aired, a video emerged of Qolian, recorded in between two rounds of her arrests, in which she described all the torture she had gone through. 29 She also revealed that she and Bakhshi had been forced to record confessions. (Location 996)</p><p>In the Name of the God of Rainbows. If the regime’s God was a murderous tyrant, a revolution was now fighting it in the name of the colours of the rainbow. (Location 1009)</p><p>Sitting on a small plastic bench, Bakhshi spoke sternly: ‘We have painted our face red with Kian’s blood, promising that we won’t ever forget. Whenever we look into the mirror, we must know our duty. We must know what we are fighting for and we must not forget all the blood that was shed.’ (Location 1013)</p><a href=#four-the-cheetah-who-died-for-the-revolution-the-fight-for-the-environment><h3 id=four-the-cheetah-who-died-for-the-revolution-the-fight-for-the-environment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Four The Cheetah Who Died for the Revolution: The Fight for the Environment</h3></a><p>Iran was at first afraid of this male cheetah, a few years her senior. But trainers taught Firouz how to be more gentle. At long last they successfully mated and Iran became pregnant.

Iranians have hence adopted them as Persian cheetahs and made them their national symbol (Location 1051)</p><p>The Persian onager has a deep place in Iranian mythology, literature and history. (Location 1058)</p><p>Hulagu conquered much of the Middle East and sacked its cultural capital, Baghdad, in 1258, single-handedly putting an end to the Islamic Golden Age. But he died in Iranian lands and was allegedly buried on Lake Urmia’s Shahi Island, although his tomb has never been found. (Location 1065)</p><p>On 28 September, when little-known singer Shervin Hajipour released a power ballad that went on to become the anthem of the Women, Life, Freedom movement, nobody was surprised that many of its lines related to the environment. Crowd-sourced from the tweets of Iranians, the song was called ‘For the Sake Of ’ (Location 1071)</p><p>a professional hunter who experienced a Damascene conversion on a trip to Africa in 1967. Eskandar arrived to hunt lions and elephants but suddenly found himself disgusted with the idea and started taking their pictures instead.
