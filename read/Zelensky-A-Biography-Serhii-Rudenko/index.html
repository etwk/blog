The only question was whether the price of these mistakes would eventually be too high for the country and, in addition, for their leader, Volodymyr Zelensky.

(Location 1413)</p><p>Haidai says that Poroshenko had his own vision of the voter: He believes that a voter is a shallow person who simply forgets what he is promised from one election to another. And he wants to hear certain lies during the campaign. The elections consist of a kind of competition between liars. And people vote for the most talented and boldest one. (Location 1418)</p><p>The more opponents pressed Zelensky, the faster his approval rating grew. And they expected Poroshenko to bring him down in a public debate. I am certain this was Poroshenko’s team’s main strategic mistake. Such mistakes had also been espoused by the staffs of former Ukrainian presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Viktor Yushchenko, who considered the competitors of their bosses to be incapable of discussion. (Location 1444)</p><p>He was answering Poroshenko’s question regarding whether he, if elected president, was ready to kneel before Putin. Zelensky answered that the words “getting down on your knees” were taken out of context. He said: Regarding knees, the words are ripped out from a phrase. Before the war, when our people, our Ukrainians, were already on the Maidan, there were those who had already perished, and I addressed each one of the presidents, and said to Yanukovych: “Be so kind as to step down from the post of presidency, ease your mind.” Then I turned to Putin and said, “I’m ready to go down on my knees, just don’t bring Ukraine to its knees.” Poroshenko shook his head in disbelief at these words. Zelensky continued: “I am now ready to kneel before every mother who did not see her son come back from the front, before every child who did not see their father come home, before every wife who did not see her husband come home. And I invite you to do the same,” and he knelt. Poroshenko also knelt down on one knee, kissing the national flag, which volunteer Tetyana Rychkova, whose husband had died in 2014 near Yenakiyeve, was holding.

(Location 1915)</p><p>Zelensky, if he was conscious of the level of his incompetence, would have created two possible scenarios. The first: in the initial months of his presidency, to gather all those who know the structure of the state apparatus of Ukraine really well and study for an hour or two every day in a special room. He had to understand very quickly what he had taken on.

And Zelensky was the one to return it. (Location 1938)</p><p>Better than anyone else, Olena knew her husband well, his strengths and weaknesses. That is why she hoped to the very end that he would refuse to run. (Location 1967)</p><p>no matter how modestly the first lady of Ukraine behaves, her husband shapes the attitude of Ukrainians toward her. From his actions, from his statements, from his successes or failures, opinions about Olena Zelensky are formed. (Location 1991)</p><p>as Volodymyr Zelensky admitted in an interview with Dmytro Gordon, when his wife is not nearby, he feels disabled. “She doesn’t think she influences me much, but she does. I really trust her,” he says. “I love her as much as I do myself. And when your wife gives you the gift of children, you realize that, damn, you love children even more than yourself, it’s a catastrophe!
