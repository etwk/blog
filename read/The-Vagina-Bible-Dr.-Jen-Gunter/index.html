(Location 152)</p><p>Medically, the vagina is only the inside, but language evolves and words take on new meaning.

A lot of this vulvar neglect is a result of patriarchal society’s lack of investment in and fear of female sexual pleasure. (Location 181)</p><p>the vulva is the outside (where your clothes touch your skin) and the vagina is the inside. The transition zone between the vulva and vagina is called the vestibule. (Location 184)</p><p>As there were no female physicians, everything first written about women’s bodies in ancient medical textbooks and taught to the first physicians was what women and midwives passed along to men, who in turn interpreted the information as they saw fit. (Location 201)</p><p>The clitoris, when it was considered by ancient physicians at all, was believed to be the female version of the penis. But lesser. (I’m sorry, but the organ, capable of multiple orgasms, that only exists for pleasure is not lesser. It is the gold standard.) (Location 213)</p><p>The vulvas of the time were but mysterious mounds concealed by crossed legs. (Location 216)</p><p>In 1938, a Los Angeles teacher, Helen Hulick, was held in contempt of court for daring to show up in pants to testify as a witness and for refusing to change into a dress when the male judge insisted. (Location 226)</p><p>A male-dominated profession, a male-dominated society with little interest in women’s experiences and opinions about their own bodies, a penis-centric view of female sexuality, and the belief propagated by Freud’s work that the clitoris was unimportant are a lot of obstacles to overcome. (Location 232)</p><p>Before the advent of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), it wasn’t really possible to know exactly how the clitoris in a living woman was positioned or how it engorges with blood in response to sexual stimulation. (Location 237)</p><p>The clitoris has one purpose: sexual pleasure. It is the only structure in the human body solely designed for pleasure. (Location 245)</p><p>THE CRURA (“ CRUS” IS THE SINGULAR): The outside arms of the inverted Y (some people also describe them as looking like the arms of a wishbone). They are 5– 9 cm in length, (Location 258)</p><p>Because the clitoris is so intimate with the urethra and the lower walls of the vagina, many experts feel a better terminology is the clitorourethrovaginal complex. (Location 263)</p><p>All parts of the clitoris are involved in sexual sensation and all parts are erectile, meaning they can engorge with blood, becoming firmer. The glans has the highest concentration of nerves and the least amount of erectile tissue. The body and the crura have the most erectile tissue. (Location 264)</p><p>For some women the glans clitoris may not be the best pathway to orgasm, so moving sexual stimulation to other areas may help achieve orgasm. (Location 271)</p><p>The labia minora are filled with specialized nerve endings important for sexual response, especially along their edge. They are capable of distinguishing touch on a very fine scale. (Location 282)</p><p>Under the microscope, all skin looks like a brick wall— cells are stacked on top of each other in layers upon multiple layers. The very bottom layer has specialized cells called basal cells. Basal cells produce new skin cells that are pushed up towards the top, like a conveyor belt. The cells develop as they move upwards, producing a protein called keratin that serves as waterproofing and makes the cells tougher so they can resist injury. At the surface, the skin cells release fatty substances that provide protection against trauma and infection, as well as trapping moisture. The cells in the top layer are dead, and they are brushed off with everyday wear and tear, or with trauma. A new layer is replaced approximately every thirty days. (Location 287)</p><p>As each pubic hair is attached to a nerve ending, tugging or friction on the hair may have a role in sexual stimulation. (Location 294)</p><p>Pubic hair follicles also have specialized sweat glands called apocrine glands (also found in the armpit) that become active during puberty. They empty a specialized oily sweat with trace amounts of hormones and pheromones onto the hair shaft. Skin bacteria convert the secretions from apocrine sweat glands into odorous compounds, which are responsible for the typical, intense apocrine sweat smell. (Location 297)</p><p>The true function of the apocrine sweat glands is not known, but as they develop and become functional around puberty and secrete pheromones, it is likely they had or still have some role in sexual attraction. (Location 300)</p><p>Skin, hair, and the irises of your eyes all get their color from the pigment melanin, which is produced by specialized skin cells called melanocytes in the basal layer. (Location 307)</p><p>Medicine still can’t explain how your back has fewer melanocytes than your vulva but they end up the same or a very similar tone. (Location 310)</p><p>Technically the vestibule is external, but the skin is similar to what you would find in the vagina: it’s mucosal skin, meaning there is very little keratin and the cells are filled with glycogen, a storage sugar. (Location 315)</p><p>The anus has two muscular rings called the internal and the external sphincter. The mucosa of the anus is highly innervated (full of nerves) because the tissue has to distinguish between solid and liquid stool as well as gas, in addition to coordinating the socially appropriate time for emptying. (Location 321)</p><p>There is no “normal” size for labia minora and labia majora. (Location 330)</p><p>Labia minora, labia majora, and the mons contribute to both sexual pleasure and protection of the vagina opening. (Location 331)</p><p>The pH of the vulvar skin is acidic, between 5.3 and 5.6. (Location 332)</p><a href=#chapter-2-the-vagina><h3 id=chapter-2-the-vagina><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 2 The Vagina</h3></a><p>The vagina is a fibromuscular tube that connects the vulva with the cervix. (Location 336)</p><p>The hymen can tear from physical activity, and approximately 50 percent of teens who report sexual activity still have an intact hymen, meaning it is a highly unreliable “virginity indicator.” (Location 342)</p><p>it’s pretty clear that for the majority of women, their sexual debut is not painful enough that they are going to hold out for some hypothetical Mr. Right. (Location 348)</p><p>I believe the hymen was a pre-puberty physical barrier against dirt and debris. (Location 355)</p><p>In a fetus, the vagina starts as a solid tube. The cells from the inside gradually disappear— this proceeds from top (the cervix) to bottom. Any remnants that remain at the lower part of the vagina are the hymen, which can be a ring, crescent shaped, have holes, or even be absent altogether. (Location 358)</p><p>The presence of a septum should be considered for any teen who has not had a period by the age of sixteen, any women who is unable to insert a tampon, fingers, a penis, or have a speculum exam due to pain, and any woman who has a feeling of an obstruction with vaginal penetration. (Location 362)</p><p>Smooth muscle is a type of muscle not under voluntary control (your gut is also made of smooth muscle). (Location 368)</p><p>There is data that suggests that some women who have painful periods have more spasms or uncoordinated activity of their vaginal smooth muscle. (Location 371)</p><p>Everyone (okay, the patriarchy) seems very impressed with the ability of a penis to grow, but the few centimeters of change that a penis can muster up pales in comparison with the vagina’s ability to stretch. (Location 373)</p><p>The vaginal smooth muscle is surrounded by a network of blood vessels. The rich blood flow is one of the reasons the vagina typically heals well after injury. (Location 375)</p><p>The vagina gets wider as you move from the vaginal opening towards the cervix. (Location 378)</p><p>On average, the pelvic floor muscles contract 3– 15 times during an orgasm. (Location 381)</p><p>Weakness or tearing of the pelvic floor, most commonly caused by childbirth, can contribute to incontinence (both bladder and bowel) and pelvic organ prolapse (descending of the pelvic organs and structures). (Location 398)</p><p>They also have much less keratin than the vulva cells, making the surface of the vagina slightly less waterproof than the vulva. This allows a small amount of fluid to leave the bloodstream and leak between the cells of the vagina to become part of the vaginal discharge. This fluid is called transudate. The reduced waterproofing also means some substances can be absorbed from the vagina into the bloodstream. (Location 403)</p><p>These dead cells are filled with the storage sugar glycogen (made of thousands of glucose molecules), which feeds the bacteria that keeps the vagina healthy. (Location 413)</p><p>The dead cells floating in the vagina work like a decoy. They are the first cells encountered by pathogenic (potentially harmful) bacteria. (Location 416)</p><p>The vagina typically produces 1– 3 ml of discharge in twenty-four hours, but up to 4 ml has been reported as normal. (Location 422)</p><p>when I was in training everyone thought L. acidophilus was most common, but that was because it was one of the only types of lactobacilli that could be grown easily in a lab. (Location 437)</p><p>Each woman has one of five community states of vaginal bacteria. Four are dominated by Lactobacillus spp. (73 percent of women); the remaining 27 percent have few lactobacilli and instead have a diverse collection of other bacteria. (Location 442)</p><p>The more lactobacilli, the more acidic the vaginal pH, (Location 446)</p><p>Vaginal pH increases during menses due to the blood itself, which has a pH of 7.35. Blood also binds lactobacilli, so lactobacilli levels are reduced with bleeding. (Location 449)</p><p>If I took a picture of your hair at 4 P.M. one day, that would not be representative of how your hair looks day to day, nor would it tell me how to wash your hair or what hair-care products to choose. (Location 458)</p><p>The folds in the vagina are called rugae. (Location 465)</p><a href=#chapter-3-vaginas-and-vulvas-in-transition><h3 id=chapter-3-vaginas-and-vulvas-in-transition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 3 Vaginas and Vulvas in Transition</h3></a><p>Sex is the designation of a person as male or female based on biological characteristics, such as anatomy and/ or hormones. Sex can be assigned at birth or changed. Gender is your sense of who you are— male, female, both, or neither. (Location 473)</p><p>Testosterone for transitioning can produce significant changes in the vulva and vagina. The clitoris will enlarge, from an average length of 1.5 cm to 4.5 cm. (Location 487)</p><p>Cervical cancer screening guidelines remain the same for trans men— screening should start at age twenty-one and continue until age sixty-five (screening can stop at sixty-five if the last three tests have been normal). (Location 503)</p><p>It is important for every person to get the HPV vaccine, but especially so for trans men who are at great risk for insufficient screening for cervical cancer and abnormal Pap smears. (Location 525)</p><p>as vaginal length is not related to sexual satisfaction, most surgeons aim for a vaginal length in the mid-range of 9– 10 cm. (Location 552)</p><p>A vagina constructed from penile skin is colonized with bacteria routinely found on the skin. (Location 555)</p><p>The advantage of colon and peritoneum tissue is that they are self-lubricating. (Location 562)</p><p>Complete hair removal can take up to a year, and electrolysis is the only truly permanent method. (Location 570)</p><p>All tobacco products impair wound healing, as they reduce blood flow in small blood vessels. (Location 573)</p><a href=#chapter-4-female-pleasure-and-sex-ed><h3 id=chapter-4-female-pleasure-and-sex-ed><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 4 Female Pleasure and Sex Ed</h3></a><p>Many heterosexual women learn about sex from male partners, who are often uneducated or undereducated themselves about the mechanics of female orgasms. (Location 599)</p><p>women who have medical conditions that interfere with their sex life, typically conditions that cause pain with sex, end up minimized. Many women suffer for years not realizing they have a medical problem that has a diagnosis and treatment. (Location 612)</p><p>the average amount of time people spend having sex is about four minutes a day. (Location 619)</p><p>A sexless relationship, meaning no sex in the past 6– 12 months, affects up to 15 percent of couples. There is less data on non-marital relationships. (Location 630)</p><p>the area in the brain that responds to nipple stimulation overlaps with the area that responds to clitoral stimulation. (Location 636)</p><p>many reasons women report wanting sexual intimacy: for example, emotionally connecting with their partner, trust, affection, safety, and respect. (Location 640)</p><p>A circular model has been proposed (by Dr. Rosemary Basson in 2000) that endorses the concept that a satisfying sexual encounter does not require starting with a spontaneous sexual drive or desire. (Location 641)</p><p>The circular model accepts that women may not always have a high spontaneous libido and that some women engage in sexual activity initially to feel intimacy or connectedness, and desire kicks in after arousal. (Location 644)</p><p>I often tell women to focus less on the idea of spontaneous libido and more on the idea of satisfaction (emotional and physical)— and, of course, fun and sexual pleasure. (Location 648)</p><p>I prefer to think of sex as a party. It doesn’t matter if you received an engraved invitation or were invited by text. It doesn’t matter if you took a limo, drove your car, took the subway, or walked. What matters is you were at the party and you had what you consider to be a good time. (Location 650)</p><p>Orgasm is the rhythmic contractions of the muscles that wrap around the vagina (the pelvic floor muscles). (Location 656)</p><p>Contracting your pelvic floor muscles voluntarily (Kegel exercises) doesn’t trigger orgasm, but many women find that purposely contracting these muscles can increase arousal. (Location 659)</p><p>Female orgasm— the contractions of the pelvic floor muscles— typically lasts 5– 60 seconds. The muscle contractions occur at approximately 0.8-second intervals (so one right after the other), and for many women each successive contraction is longer, but weaker. The general range of contractions, number-wise, is 3– 15. Orgasm is accompanied by a feeling of well-being and/ or release of tension.
