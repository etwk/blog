It is done by how you live your life. My life is my teaching. My life is my message. &ndash; THICH NHAT HANH (Location 23)</p><a href=#at-home-in-the-world><h3 id=at-home-in-the-world><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>At Home in the World</h3></a><p>In 1968 during the Vietnam War, I went to France to represent the Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation at the Paris Peace Talks. Our mission was to speak out against the war on behalf of the mass of Vietnamese people whose voices were not being heard. (Location 122)</p><p>The French government granted me asylum, and I was able to obtain an apatride travel document. Apatride means you don’t belong to any country; you become stateless. (Location 133)</p><p>The practice brought me back to my true home in the here and now. Eventually I stopped suffering, and the dream did not come back anymore. (Location 156)</p><p>It was because I didn’t belong to any particular country that I had to make an effort to break through and find my true home. (Location 168)</p><a href=#life-in-vietnam><h3 id=life-in-vietnam><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Life in Vietnam</h3></a><p>I was able to spend so much time eating my cookie because I did not have much to worry about. I was not thinking about the future; I was not regretting the past. I was dwelling entirely in the present moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and everything. (Location 175)</p><p>It is possible to eat our meals as slowly and joyfully as I ate the cookie of my childhood. (Location 177)</p><p>The present moment is filled with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. (Location 180)</p><p>Life in Vietnam when I was young was quite different from the way it is now. A birthday party, a poetry reading, or the anniversary of a family member’s death would last all day, not only a few hours. You could arrive and leave at any time. You didn’t need to have a car or a bike— you just walked. If you lived far away, you set out the day before and spent the night at a friend’s house along the way. No matter what time you arrived, you were welcomed and served food. When the first four people had arrived, they were served together at a table. If you were the fifth, you waited until three others came so you could eat together with them. (Location 182)</p><p>time is not money. Time has much more value than money. Time is life. Money is nothing compared with life. (Location 192)</p><p>having a toilet to clean at all can be enough to make us happy. (Location 200)</p><p>when we want more insight into a situation, we need to entrust the task of finding a solution to the deeper level of our consciousness. Struggling with our thinking mind will not help. (Location 208)</p><p>Our unconscious mind, which in Buddhism is called our “store consciousness,” knows how to listen. It collaborates with the thinking part of our mind (Location 211)</p><p>When we meditate, we don’t only use our mind consciousness; we need to use and trust our store consciousness. (Location 212)</p><p>Deep breathing, looking deeply, and allowing ourselves simply to be, will help our store consciousness offer the best insight. (Location 213)</p><p>When I was a small boy of seven or eight, I happened to see a drawing of the Buddha on the cover of a Buddhist magazine. The Buddha was sitting on the grass, very peacefully, and I was impressed. (Location 218)</p><p>He saw the suffering in his kingdom and he saw how his father, King Suddhodana, tried to reduce the suffering around him, but seemed to be helpless. To young Siddhartha, politics seemed ineffective. Even as a teenager, he was searching for a way out of suffering. (Location 224)</p><p>We are searching for something good, true, and beautiful to follow. But looking around we can’t find what we’re looking for and we become disillusioned. (Location 228)</p><p>Buddha is not the name of a particular person; buddha is just a common name to designate anyone who has a high degree of peace and who has a high degree of understanding and compassion. (Location 233)</p><p>birth and death are only waves on the surface of the ocean, not the ocean itself, just like the beautiful images in the kaleidoscope. (Location 241)</p><p>There is no birth and no death. There is only continuation. (Location 242)</p><p>hermit— a monk who lived alone and sat quietly day and night to become calm and peaceful like the Buddha. (Location 246)</p><p>We cooked rice, rolled it into balls, and wrapped them in banana leaves. We prepared sesame seeds, peanuts, and salt to dip the rice in. (Location 248)</p><p>The water tasted so good. I had never tasted anything as good as that water. I felt completely satisfied; I did not need or want anything at all— even the desire to meet the hermit was gone. (Location 258)</p><p>I fell into a deep sleep. I don’t know how long I slept. When I woke up, I didn’t know where I was. Then I saw the branch of the tree against the sky and the wonderful well. I remembered everything. (Location 261)</p><p>It was many years ago that I climbed that mountain. But the image of the well and the quiet, peaceful sound of the dripping water are still alive inside me. You too may have met your hermit. Maybe as a rock, a tree, a star, or a beautiful sunset. (Location 267)</p><p>That was my first spiritual experience. After that I became calmer and quieter. I didn’t feel the need to share what had happened. I wanted to keep it in my heart. (Location 269)</p><p>a book of fifty practice poems called “Gathas for Everyday Use” compiled by a great Chinese Zen master. (Location 276)</p><p>Using gathas to help us become aware of our everyday actions is a Zen monastic tradition going back over a thousand years. (Location 277)</p><p>Elements of monastic culture can also be experienced by people who live in society. (Location 288)</p><p>later on I wrote a poem for driving a car as well. Poems like these can help us live each moment deeply, in awareness and in touch with the spiritual dimension of life. (Location 297)</p><p>My teacher handed me the robe. I received it knowing it was tremendous encouragement and that it was given with a tender and discreet love. (Location 322)</p><p>Although it wasn’t yet time for the ordination ceremony and I was not yet kneeling before the Buddha, uttering the great vow to save all beings, my heart made the vast and deep vow with all sincerity to live a life of service. Brother Tam Man looked at me with wholehearted affection and respect. In that moment, the universe for us was truly a universe of fragrant flowers. (Location 326)</p><p>Thanks to the wisdom of nondiscrimination, called upeksha in Sanskrit, we do not fight, quarrel, or compete with one another. When we are not caught in the notion of being a separate self from other human beings, there can be harmony between us. (Location 340)</p><p>In Vietnam we used to pick the best kind of wheat when it was still young and put it in warm water to sprout. Once it sprouted, we would cook it and condense it into a kind of paste. We didn’t put sugar in it, yet it was still a little bit sweet from the fermentation. We concentrated it until it was very thick. Then we would go to the river and pick up small pebbles, wash them very thoroughly, and dry them in the sunshine. We would cover the pebbles with the wheat-germ paste and dry them again, so that each pebble was caked in wheat-germ paste. That is what our ancestors used to eat when they drank their tea. (Location 348)</p><p>Sometimes the weather might suddenly become cooler, and the cherry blossoms wouldn’t have enough time to bloom before the event. In that case, people would bring a drum to the foot of the cherry tree, and play the drum to stimulate the flowers to bloom. That’s the way it was in the past. It may sound childish, but it was very poetic and very beautiful. (Location 355)</p><p>taking time to create a special moment to drink tea or eat a meal together with joy, beauty, and simplicity can initiate your children into a spiritual life. (Location 363)</p><p>Suppose you need to stand in line, waiting for your turn to buy or serve yourself some food. You can take the opportunity to practice mindful breathing, aware of your in-breath and your out-breath, enjoying yourself and the presence of the people around you. (Location 369)</p><p>Meditation can be very informal. When you drive, if you drive with mindfulness, enjoying your in-breath and out-breath, we can say you are practicing meditation. (Location 371)</p><p>With the energy of mindfulness, every action in our daily life can become pleasurable. (Location 373)</p><p>Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, (Location 380)</p><p>To my mind, the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when you aren’t doing them. (Location 402)</p><p>each minute, each second of life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing them are miracles! (Location 406)</p><p>If I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, if I want to finish them quickly so I can go and have dessert or a cup of tea, I will be equally incapable of enjoying my dessert or my tea when I finally have them. (Location 407)</p><p>Each thought, each action in the sunlight of awareness becomes sacred. In this light, no boundary exists between the sacred and the profane. (Location 411)</p><p>True love requires deep understanding. In fact, love is another name for understanding. (Location 425)</p><p>Without understanding, your love will only cause the other person to suffer. (Location 426)</p><p>At that time, many young people in Vietnam were inspired to join political and revolutionary groups like the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. (Location 438)</p><p>Many young monastics were attracted to Marxist ideology and were tempted out of the monasteries to join these movements. (Location 440)</p><p>Taking action against injustice is not enough. We believed action must embody mindfulness. If there is no awareness, action will only cause more harm. (Location 442)</p><p>Our editorial team began reporting on the Buddhist community’s work to help bring peace and reunify the country. Buddhists were speaking out, leading huge street protests and hunger strikes, and writing articles and letters. (Location 460)</p><p>engaged practice was not only possible, it was necessary if we were going to make real and peaceful change. (Location 467)</p><a href=#war-and-exile><h3 id=war-and-exile><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>War and Exile</h3></a><p>Only later did I learn that one of the elder monks had secretly buried a large container of rice on the temple grounds, deep in the earth. (Location 477)</p><p>I do not accept the concept of war for peace, nor of a “just war,” in the same way that I cannot accept the concepts of “just slavery,” “just hatred,” or “just racism.” (Location 491)</p><p>I turned on my flashlight and aimed it into the room we thought was empty— and I saw fifty or sixty monks sitting still and silent in meditation.” (Location 528)</p><p>He found the fragrant mushroom rice soup my brother had prepared so delicious, he couldn’t believe it was vegetarian. (Location 559)</p><p>He allowed the lives of all living beings to fill his heart, and he saw the senselessness and destructiveness of war. What made it all possible was that moment of complete and total stopping and opening to the powerful, healing, miraculous ocean called silence. (Location 569)</p><p>Simply savoring that plate of fresh herbs was enough to restore my balance. (Location 581)</p><p>As activists, we have a deep desire to succeed in our attempt to help the world. But if we don’t maintain a balance between our work and the nourishment we need, we won’t be very successful. (Location 584)</p><p>Taking action helps us not to drown in despair. (Location 613)</p><p>Mindfulness must be engaged. Once we see that something needs to be done, we must take action. Seeing and acting go together. (Location 618)</p><p>We must be aware of the real problems of the world. Then, with mindfulness, concentration, and insight, we will know what to do and what not to do in order to help. (Location 619)</p><p>Are you planting seeds of joy and peace? I try to do exactly that with every step. (Location 622)</p><p>By sitting very still and talking in a very calm voice, I hoped to convey that I had a lot of sympathy for him and the fact that the war had created a lot of victims, not only among the Vietnamese but also among the Americans. (Location 636)</p><p>Danger often comes from the inside. (Location 640)</p><p>But we would be the only people in our poor neighborhood with an air conditioner, and that would change the way people looked at us. (Location 650)</p><p>In Vietnam, friends drop by whenever they feel like it. No one telephones first or makes an appointment. (Location 654)</p><p>“boatpeople”— Vietnamese refugees who were attempting to escape persecution and violence at home. (Location 664)</p><p>The suffering we touched doing this kind of work was so deep that if we did not have a reservoir of spiritual strength, we would not have been able to continue. (Location 685)</p><p>“If you want peace, peace is with you immediately.” (Location 705)</p><p>If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, then the kind of peace I might have in simpler times is meaningless. If I could not find peace in the midst of difficulty, I knew I would never know real peace. (Location 709)</p><p>Success finally came when I faced the problem directly. (Location 712)</p><p>Sometimes you have to react quickly while remaining calm. If you are angry or suspicious, you cannot do it. You have to be clear-minded. (Location 758)</p><p>You, the minister of education, were a teacher too, before having a high position in the government. You are like a big brother to us younger teachers.” When he heard this, the minister’s heart softened. He apologized and did not take any more action against Sister Chan Khong. (Location 771)</p><p>When we see clearly with the eyes of understanding and compassion, we no longer feel that we are the victims of violence. We can even open the heart and the eyes of the person we feel is trying to hurt us. (Location 773)</p><p>To burn ourselves like that was not an act of violence. It was an act of compassion, an act of peace. (Location 780)</p><p>Our enemy is not outside of us. Our true enemy is the anger, hatred, and discrimination that is found in the hearts and minds of man. (Location 789)</p><p>I made a deep vow to continue building what he called “the beloved community,” (Location 801)</p><p>During his four years there, he practiced meditation and was able to live with inner peace. By the time he was released, his mind was as sharp as a sword. (Location 811)</p><p>no one can ever steal our determination or our freedom. No one can ever steal our practice. (Location 814)</p><p>Sometimes people have a certain idea or way of looking at things, and they want to put you in a box. (Location 820)</p><p>It’s the reality of the thing that matters, and not the word we use to describe it. (Location 822)</p><p>Each one of us is constantly changing. We don’t need to be caught in an idea of ourselves from many years ago. (Location 829)</p><p>The oppressed and the oppressors lie within each one of us, and our practice is to attain the wisdom of nondiscrimination. (Location 840)</p><p>Don’t think that when someone is in a coma, you can no longer communicate with them. Speak to them anyway. Somehow, they can perceive your message. (Location 857)</p><p>Nobody had ever taught me how to love, how to understand, how to see the suffering of others. My father and mother were not taught this either.
