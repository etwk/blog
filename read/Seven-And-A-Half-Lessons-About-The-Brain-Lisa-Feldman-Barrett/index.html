(Location 60)</p><p>the idea that our brains evolved for thinking has been the source of many profound misconceptions about human nature. (Location 70)</p><p>Both predators and prey evolved to sense more of the world around them. (Location 80)</p><p>Energy efficiency was a key to survival. (Location 93)</p><p>Every action you take (or don’t take) is an economic choice ​— ​ your brain is guessing when to spend resources and when to save them. (Location 97)</p><p>When it came to body budgeting, prediction beat reaction. (Location 102)</p><p>allostasis. It means automatically predicting and preparing to meet the body’s needs before they arise. (Location 109)</p><p>All sorts of animals, including humans, somehow conjure up past experiences to prepare their bodies for action. (Location 114)</p><p>as animals gradually evolved bigger bodies with more systems to maintain, their handful of body-budgeting cells also evolved to become brains of greater and greater complexity. (Location 128)</p><p>evolution does not act with purpose— ​ there is no “why.” (Location 135)</p><p>Your brain continually invests your energy in the hopes of earning a good return, such as food, shelter, affection, or physical protection, so you can perform nature’s most vital task: passing your genes to the next generation. (Location 138)</p><p>all of these mental capacities are consequences of a central mission to keep you alive and well by managing your body budget. Everything your brain creates, from memories to hallucinations, from ecstasy to shame, is part of this mission. (Location 142)</p><a href=#lesson-no-1-you-have-one-brain-not-three><h3 id=lesson-no-1-you-have-one-brain-not-three><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lesson No. 1 You Have One Brain (Not Three)</h3></a><p>Plato’s compelling morality tale of inner conflict remains one of the most cherished narratives in Western civilization. (Location 164)</p><p>According to this evolutionary story, the human brain ended up with three layers ​— ​ one for surviving, one for feeling, and one for thinking ​— ​ an arrangement known as the triune brain. (Location 169)</p><p>The triune brain idea is one of the most successful and widespread errors in all of science. (Location 181)</p><p>Bad behavior doesn’t come from ancient and unbridled inner beasts. Good behavior is not the result of rationality. And rationality and emotion are not at war . . . (Location 186)</p><p>By the 1990s, experts had completely rejected the idea of a three-layered brain. It simply didn’t hold up when they analyzed neurons with more sophisticated tools. (Location 202)</p><p>In MacLean’s day, scientists compared one animal brain to another by injecting them with dye, slicing them paper-thin like deli meat, and squinting at the stained slices through a microscope. (Location 204)</p><p>This arrangement among brain regions ​— ​ segregating and then integrating ​— ​ creates a more complex brain that can control a larger and more complex body. (Location 220)</p><p>The neurons that form a mammal’s brain are created in an astonishingly predictable order. The ordering holds true for mice, rats, dogs, cats, horses, anteaters, humans, and every other mammalian species studied so far, and genetic evidence strongly suggests the order holds for reptiles, birds, and some fish. (Location 232)</p><p>the manufacturing process runs in stages, and the stages last for shorter or longer durations in different species. The biological building blocks are the same; what differs is the timing. (Location 236)</p><p>All mammals have a relatively big cortex in a brain that’s relatively large for their body size. (Location 253)</p><p>during the course of evolution, certain genes mutated to cause particular stages of brain development to run for longer or shorter times, producing a brain with proportionally bigger or smaller parts. (Location 260)</p><p>other animals have evolved abilities that surpass ours in significant ways. (Location 269)</p><p>Natural selection did not aim itself toward us ​— ​ we’re just an interesting sort of animal with particular adaptations that helped us survive and reproduce in particular environments. Other animals are not inferior to humans. They are uniquely and effectively adapted to their environments. (Location 272)</p><p>Your brain is not more evolved than a rat or lizard brain, just differently evolved. (Location 274)</p><p>To believe in the triune brain is to award ourselves a first prize trophy for Best Species. (Location 279)</p><p>If you choose not to act rationally, then your behavior may be called immoral, and if you’re unable to act rationally, you are considered mentally ill. (Location 282)</p><p>sometimes thinking isn’t rational, like when you scroll through social media for hours, telling yourself you’re bound to come across something important. (Location 285)</p><p>Perhaps rationality is better defined in terms of the brain’s most important job: body budgeting (Location 286)</p><p>What we call mental illnesses, then, may be rational body-budgeting for the short term that’s out of sync with the immediate environment, the needs of other people, or your own best interests down the road. (Location 300)</p><p>Many other social institutions are steeped in the idea of a mind at war with itself. (Location 308)</p><p>You have one brain, not three. To move past Plato’s ancient battle, we might need to fundamentally rethink what it means to be rational, what it means to be responsible for our actions, and perhaps even what it means to be human. (Location 312)</p><a href=#lesson-no-2-your-brain-is-a-network><h3 id=lesson-no-2-your-brain-is-a-network><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lesson No. 2 Your Brain Is a Network</h3></a><p>Today, we remain surrounded by so-called facts about the brain that are also just metaphors. (Location 320)</p><p>a network of 128 billion neurons connected as a single, massive, and flexible structure. A brain network (Location 334)</p><p>Your neurons never just sit around waiting for something in the outside world to make them fire. Instead, all of your neurons chat constantly with one another through their wiring. (Location 346)</p><p>Communication in your brain is a balancing act between speed and cost. Each neuron directly passes information to just a few thousand other neurons and receives information from a few thousand others, give or take, yielding over five hundred trillion neuron-to-neuron connections. (Location 349)</p><p>Brain hubs, like airport hubs, make a complicated system efficient. They allow most neurons to participate globally even as they focus more locally. (Location 364)</p><p>Hubs are points of vulnerability because they are points of efficiency (Location 370)</p><p>some of these chemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine, can also act on other neurotransmitters to dial up or dial down their effects. When brain chemicals act in this way, we call them neuromodulators. (Location 378)</p><p>Neuromodulators and neurotransmitters together allow your brain’s single structure to take on trillions of different patterns of activity. (Location 380)</p><p>if you blindfold people with typical vision for a few days and teach them to read braille, neurons in their visual cortex become more devoted to the sense of touch. Remove the blindfold, and the effect disappears after twenty-four hours. (Location 388)</p><p>Even a simple reaching action like this, when done more than once, can be guided by different sets of neurons. This phenomenon is called degeneracy. Scientists suspect that all biological systems have degeneracy. (Location 400)</p><p>Degeneracy in the brain means that your actions and experiences can be created in multiple ways. (Location 405)</p><p>complexity. It is a brain’s ability to configure itself into an enormous number of distinct neural patterns. (Location 409)</p><p>Complexity empowers a brain to act flexibly in all kinds of situations. (Location 414)</p><p>Complexity also helps us contemplate the whole world beyond our immediate surroundings, even outer space, and care about the past and the future to an extent that other animals do not. (Location 416)</p><p>Complexity means your brain can create massive numbers of different patterns by combining bits and pieces of old patterns it has made before. (Location 420)</p><p>when existing brain parts become more flexible, the result is much more complexity than we get by accumulating new parts. (Location 441)</p><p>it reconstructs them on demand with electricity and swirling chemicals. We call this process remembering but it’s really assembling. (Location 444)</p><p>Brains of higher complexity are also more creative. (Location 447)</p><p>Intelligent behavior has emerged many times in different species with differently structured brains. (Location 455)</p><p>The highly complex human brain isn’t a pinnacle of evolution, remember; it’s just well adapted to the environments we inhabit. (Location 457)</p><p>Metaphors are wonderful for explaining complex topics in simple, familiar terms. A metaphor’s simplicity, however, can become its greatest failing if people treat the metaphor as an explanation. (Location 472)</p><p>Metaphors provide the illusion of knowledge, so they must be used with care. (Location 476)</p><p>Your brain is more than just neurons. It includes blood vessels and various fluids that I haven’t talked about. It also includes other kinds of brain cells, called glial cells, that function in ways that scientists don’t fully understand yet. Your brain network may even extend, surprisingly, into your gut and intestines, where scientists have found microbes that communicate with your brain via neurotransmitters. (Location 478)</p><a href=#lesson-no-3-little-brains-wire-themselves-to-their-world><h3 id=lesson-no-3-little-brains-wire-themselves-to-their-world><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lesson No. 3 Little Brains Wire Themselves to Their World</h3></a><p>Many animals emerge from the egg or womb with brains that are more fully wired to control their bodies, but little human brains are born under construction. (Location 488)</p><p>To a remarkable extent, a baby’s genes are guided and regulated by the surrounding environment. (Location 496)</p><p>A baby’s wiring instructions come not only from the physical environment but also from the social environment, from caregivers and people like you and me. (Location 502)</p><p>Genes play a key role in building a baby’s brain wiring, and they also open the door for us to wire her newborn brain in the context of her culture. (Location 506)</p><p>As information travels from the world into the newborn brain, some neurons fire together more frequently than others, causing gradual brain changes that we’ve called plasticity. These changes nudge the infant’s brain toward higher complexity via two processes we’ll call tuning and pruning. (Location 507)</p><p>Tuning means strengthening the connections between neurons, (Location 510)</p><p>less-used connections weaken and die off. This is the process of pruning, (Location 516)</p><p>Pruning is critical in a developing brain, because little humans are born with many more connections than they will ultimately use. (Location 517)</p><p>Buds that aren’t tuned disappear within a couple of days. (Location 524)</p><p>If caregivers do these activities effectively, the baby’s brain is free to tune and prune itself to perform healthy body budgeting. (Location 532)</p><p>Little brains are also wired by what caregivers don’t do. (Location 536)</p><p>When an infant is crying for a long time and you don’t check in regularly, her brain may learn that the world is unreliable and unsafe while her body budget goes untended. (Location 537)</p><p>In general, toddlers learn to tend their own body budgets better when their caregivers create learning opportunities for them instead of hovering and taking care of their every need. (Location 541)</p><p>“cocktail party effect.”) Your adult brain can effortlessly focus on one thing and ignore others, (Location 545)</p><p>the newborn brain doesn’t have a spotlight. It has more of a lantern, illuminating a wide area in its physical environment. Newborn brains don’t know what’s important and what’s not, so they cannot focus as adults do. (Location 549)</p><p>The mother’s speech and the back-and-forth switching of gaze, which scientists call sharing attention, alert the baby that the toy dog is significant (Location 553)</p><p>its own environment of what is relevant to its body budget and what can be ignored. Scientists call this environment a niche. (Location 556)</p><p>Every animal has a niche, and it creates that niche as it senses the world, makes worthwhile movements, and regulates its body budget. (Location 557)</p><p>Your niche extends far beyond your immediate surroundings to include events around the world, past, present, and future. (Location 558)</p><p>After months of practice sharing attention with caregivers, an infant will learn to elicit shared attention from them. (Location 560)</p><p>If you heard only one language as a baby, you’d need to relearn the ability to hear and distinguish sounds outside your language, which is hard. (Location 571)</p><p>When you were a baby, you learned to recognize the people around you. Your infant brain was tuned and pruned to detect fine differences in their faces so you could tell them apart. (Location 572)</p><p>you can quickly retune your brain and restore this ability by looking at lots of diverse faces; it’s much easier than retuning to the sounds of a foreign language. (Location 576)</p><p>when you kiss someone, you are enveloped in a unified experience that combines the sight of a face, the sound of breathing, the feel, taste, and scent of luscious lips, and the racing of your heart. Your brain assembles these sensations into a cohesive whole. Scientists call this process sensory integration. (Location 578)</p><p>Sensory integration itself is tuned and pruned as babies grow. (Location 581)</p><p>A newborn at first can’t recognize his mother by her face, because he hasn’t learned what a face is, and his visual system isn’t fully formed. He might know a bit about how his mother sounds, and he can smell her breast milk. (Location 581)</p><p>Sensory integration conjures his first feeling of trust. It’s part of the neural foundation for attachment. (Location 585)</p><p>Little brains require a social world in order to develop typically. (Location 588)</p><p>they also need social inputs from other humans who guide their attention, speak or sing to them, and cuddle them at key moments. If these needs aren’t met, things can go terribly wrong. (Location 590)</p><p>As a consequence of this social neglect, the Romanian orphans grew up intellectually impaired. They had problems learning language. They had difficulty concentrating and resisting distractions, probably because nobody had shared attention with them, so their brains never developed the wiring for an effective spotlight. They also had trouble controlling themselves. Alongside the children’s mental and behavioral issues, their bodies were stunted, most likely because they grew up without caregivers to keep their body budgets solvent. (Location 600)</p><p>A little brain wires itself to its environment, and when that environment is missing key elements for healthy body budgeting, critical brain wiring can be pruned away. (Location 604)</p><p>Similar risks can arise for any kids reared in institutions without attentive, consistent caregivers, whether these institutions are orphanages, refugee camps, or immigrant detention centers. (Location 608)</p><p>When children are persistently neglected, in all likelihood they’ll suffer ill effects eventually.
