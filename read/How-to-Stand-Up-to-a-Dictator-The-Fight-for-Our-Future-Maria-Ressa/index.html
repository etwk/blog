(Location 43)</p><p>there are, today, more autocracies in the world than there are democracies. (Location 56)</p><p>Elie Wiesel warned us that there may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.

(Location 82)</p><p>social media has destroyed our shared reality, the place where democracy happens. (Location 111)</p><p>Impunity online naturally led to impunity offline, destroying existing checks and balances. (Location 114)</p><p>Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without all three, we have no shared reality, and democracy as we know it— and all meaningful human endeavors— are dead. (Location 118)</p><p>what I lay out in this book: an exploration into the values and principles not just of journalism and technology but of the collective action we need to take to win this battle for facts. (Location 120)</p><p>You will see the simple ideas I hold on to in order to make what have— over time— become instinctive but thoughtful decisions, layering experiences upon new experiences of the present moment of the past. (Location 123)</p><p>The goals of the gatekeepers and the disinformation operatives aligned. (Location 136)</p><p>whoever won the election would determine not just our future but also our past. You can’t have integrity of elections if you don’t have integrity of facts. (Location 152)</p><p>Their accomplice is technology, the silent nuclear holocaust in our information ecosystem. We must treat its aftermath the way the world did after the devastation of World War II: creating institutions and agreements like NATO, the United Nations, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (Location 156)</p><p>Democracy is fragile. You have to fight for every bit, every law, every safeguard, every institution, every story. (Location 162)</p><p>Please ask yourself the same question my team and I ask every day: What are you willing to sacrifice for the truth?

(Location 177)</p><p>Meaning is not something you stumble across or what someone gives you; you build it through every choice you make, the commitments you choose, the people you love, and the values you hold dear. (Location 180)</p><p>a sprawling archipelago of disparate languages and cultures united by the Catholic Church. (Location 189)</p><p>The joke about colonial rule is that the Philippines spent three hundred years in a convent and fifty years in Hollywood. (Location 196)</p><p>She taught me to work hard in school and instilled a mindset of delayed gratification: (Location 206)</p><p>My mom was larger than life: petite, beautiful, always full of laughter. (Location 213)</p><p>my friend Stanley Karnow wrote in his epic In Our Image: America’s Empire in the Philippines. “Americans neglected to establish an effective and impartial administration . . . so Filipinos turned to politicians instead of the bureaucracy for assistance, a practice that fostered patronage and corruption.” (Location 246)</p><p>Our family believed in America: you worked hard, you paid your taxes, and you got what you deserved. (Location 254)</p><p>I know what it does to people, how uncertainty and fear grow, how those who work hard and follow the rules feel cheated when promises are broken. When you throw in social media and information operations, those same people are targeted and susceptible; they believe the lies. (Location 256)</p><p>the school, like St. Scholastica’s back in the Philippines, used the SRA Reading Lab, one of the earliest personalized learning programs for reading, writing, and comprehension, which allowed students to move at their own pace. (Location 279)</p><p>I am by nature shy, an introvert. (Location 284)</p><p>I remember my silence as learning, a continuation of the “speak when you’re spoken to” mentality from my upbringing and schooling in the Philippines. I was soaking in my new world like a sponge. (Location 285)</p><p>Somehow you adopt the dreams that float in the air around you. (Location 290)</p><p>When the world became overwhelming, I channeled my energies into hours of practicing the piano. (Location 293)</p><p>The first was always to make the choice to learn. That meant embracing change and mustering the courage to fail; success and failure are two sides of the same coin. You cannot succeed if at some point you haven’t failed. Most people, I realized, chose comfort, remaining in what was familiar: old friends, routines, habits. (Location 298)</p><p>I made real everything I learned. All I had to do was practice. (Location 306)</p><p>my second lesson: to embrace my fear. (Location 311)</p><p>When you take a risk, you have to trust that someone will come to your aid; and when it’s your turn, you will help someone else. It’s better to face your fear than to run from it because running won’t make the problem go away. When you face it, you have the chance to conquer it. That was how I began to define courage. (Location 323)</p><p>My third lesson was about standing up to bullies, (Location 325)</p><p>Since everything was foreign to me, I usually had no choice but to stay quiet, observe, and learn. Because I was already so different from the others, I felt the need to conform much less and had the luxury of observing and understanding the crowd without ever being part of it. (Location 326)</p><p>silence is complicity. (Location 331)</p><p>what I learned about popularity: people like you if you give them what they want. The question is: Is it what you want? (Location 341)</p><p>Mr. Spaulding was not only my violin teacher and orchestra conductor; he helped me learn to play up to eight different instruments. He nurtured me and others like me: kids looking for our place in the world. (Location 348)</p><p>another lesson you learned while in Don Spaulding’s orbit: that no one can accomplish anything meaningful alone. (Location 355)</p><p>how good a team player you are depends on your skills, your drive, your endurance. (Location 357)</p><p>The magic happened when all of the work faded into the background and we lived inside the music, interpreting the notes and creating music together. To get to that point required hours and hours of practice. (Location 359)</p><p>an orchestra was a perfect metaphor for a working democracy: the music gave the people our notes, our systems, but how you play, feel, and follow— and how you lead— that’s all up to you. (Location 361)</p><p>books were what explained everything to me that people couldn’t— or answered questions I couldn’t ask. (Location 364)</p><p>I loved Harlequin romances and science fiction novels, which helped me imagine different worlds such as the ones Isaac Asimov built. (Location 365)</p><p>I read all the Star Trek novelizations by James Blish and had a shelf at home where I collected them. The books helped me understand my own mind. (Location 366)</p><p>To this day, when someone asks me who my heroes are, I point to the combination of Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk, rational logical analysis tempered by empathy, instinct, and emotions. (Location 370)</p><p>I applied to thirteen colleges including six-year med programs, military academies, and several Ivy League schools. (Location 379)</p><p>I was pragmatic. Even if I didn’t understand the devil on my shoulder, I knew that learning— and learning beyond standard school books— would only help me. (Location 382)</p><a href=#chapter-2-the-honor-code-draw-the-line><h4 id=chapter-2-the-honor-code-draw-the-line><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2 The Honor Code Draw the Line</h4></a><p>My freshman year, I studied all five major world religions: Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism. (Location 401)</p><p>I saw how the rules of science, of physics, were philosophical, like the laws of thermodynamics: how everything moves to maximum entropy or chaos, and how it takes energy to maintain order. (Location 404)</p><p>the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which I would use as the epigraph of my first book: that the very act of observing changes what you observe and that the more you drill down, the more unknowable what you are searching for becomes. (Location 406)</p><p>That Honor Code helped me define my values early and clearly— before any moral dilemma could tempt me to rationalize selfish, bad behavior. It helped me avoid situational ethics later in life. It was simple. Draw the line: on one side you’re good; the other, you’re evil. (Location 417)</p><p>They made me realize how much I had compensated for being an outsider, always pursuing perfection to fill the absence of belonging. (Location 422)</p><p>Of them all, I learned the most from theater, even things as simple as breathing: lying down, breathing deeply, visualizing air and energy going in and out, centering yourself in the moment. Letting your mind and body work together to be absolutely present. (Location 424)</p><p>in order to have a clear view of the world, you have to ask yourself the toughest questions. (Location 443)</p><p>Staying silent or compliant changed nothing. Speaking up was an act of creation. (Location 447)</p><p>In playwriting class, I also learned to be more consciously creative, to gain comfort with uncertainty and continue to explore. (Location 448)</p><p>I had always tended to avoid negative emotions like anger, but my acting teacher pushed me to immerse myself in the emotion. (Location 449)</p><p>Trying to understand why led me back to the past. My boyfriend urged me to read Alice Miller’s The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self, (Location 452)</p><p>Another key text for me during that time was T. S. Eliot’s essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” He argued that the way you read William Shakespeare is affected by the last novel you read, and the last novel you read is affected by the fact that you read Shakespeare. This notion collapses time, space, and tradition because both past and present coexist, changing each other and creating the future. (Location 463)</p><p>I set myself a twofold challenge: how to understand the world and my place in it, and how to build my confidence while controlling my ego. I wanted to achieve an “empty mirror,” a concept I took from a book about a Buddhist monastery: to stand in front of a mirror and see the world without my image obstructing the view. I wanted to know myself to such a degree that I could take myself out of the equation when approaching the world around me and responding to it. That is clarity— the ability to remove your self and your ego. (Location 475)</p><p>Their ostentatiousness was so lurid that it humiliated their people. (Location 487)</p><p>Conflicted about loyalty to the different characters in my play, I also discovered a greater sense of empathy within the political and for political actors. (Location 507)</p><p>even then I knew that intellect without emotion is flawed— and that some of the greatest insights can come only from letting go, something I still was reluctant to do. (Location 512)</p><p>I was learning how to make decisions, but, afraid to make mistakes, I sometimes took too long to make them. (Location 514)</p><p>whenever I was lost or needed to make a quick decision, I began to develop a formula: I look at what I’m afraid of, downplay my ego, then follow the Golden Rule and the Honor Code. (Location 515)</p><p>Home is about emotional roots: culture, food, implicit values, the warmth of familiarity. You belong there. It has its rituals that mark the passage of time and give it meaning. (Location 525)</p><p>I finally felt comfortable being an outsider looking in, wanting to belong but comfortable with observing. (Location 527)</p><a href=#chapter-3-the-speed-of-trust-be-vulnerable><h4 id=chapter-3-the-speed-of-trust-be-vulnerable><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3 The Speed of Trust Be Vulnerable</h4></a><p>The systems, which needed to adapt to broadcasting breaking news, were only as powerful as the strengths and weaknesses of the people on the team. (Location 576)</p><p>“envelopmental journalism,” referring to the envelope of money that organizers of press conferences often handed out to the journalists attending. (Location 596)</p><p>In the Philippines, there was a personal cost to calling out an error or demanding better in a work culture; SIR, or “smooth interpersonal relations,” had long been prioritized. So we created our own team and energized them with a vision of what we wanted our newscast to be. (Location 620)</p><p>We wanted video with the tightest editing, sequenced properly to tell a story, instead of a B-roll that unfurled lazily and meaninglessly. (Location 622)</p><p>It was always easy to spot self-censorship in an anchor read because the phrasing was angled to please the boss, at best, or avoid angering power, at worst. (Location 626)</p><p>the mindset of mediocrity, when you settle for what you can get instead of pushing for more. (Location 637)</p><p>during a military takeover one of the first things rebellious soldiers do is seize the government radio or television station to control information. (Location 644)</p><p>I made the choice to learn, but it was more than that— I learned to trust: to drop my shields and be vulnerable. I have rarely been disappointed when I do. That, to me, is strength and why I believe in the goodness of human nature. When you’re vulnerable, you create the strongest bonds and the most inspiring possibilities. (Location 668)</p><p>In my early twenties, I learned how to create and build a team that was more powerful than the sum of its parts. (Location 673)</p><p>I wasn’t just learning by doing; I was learning how to lead. (Location 675)</p><p>She also taught me to embrace and love the Philippines, despite its imperfections. (Location 691)</p><p>What she said then has stayed with me until today and still influences the way I defend our journalism. “Our integrity and our credibility are on the line here,” she said. “So if anybody comes and says that we cannot air a piece or wants to preview a piece, that to us is tantamount to muzzling our freedom of the press. . . . And we will never, never, never agree to be intimidated by anyone, no matter who he is.” (Location 700)</p><p>What you choose to do shapes the person you become. Nothing shaped my personality— or my ability to withstand threats— more than becoming a breaking-news television journalist, learning to maintain my composure while live and even under literal gunfire.

As mentioned previously, the best lies are half-truths that work to support a metanarrative, like “Duterte is the best leader” or “Journalists are criminals.” Step two was to use natural language processing, using computers to process large amounts of text to pull out the consistent messages of networks of disinformation.

I could focus on what had increasingly become my obsession: how technology and journalism were shaping politics and public policy as well as what it means for public leadership.

He did, however, repeatedly paint a glowing future and promised to make the Philippines great again. (Location 3740)</p><p>My hope is that others can replicate our three pillars: technology, journalism, and community to fight back and build forward. First, we must demand accountability from technology. This has to start with government action, as the social media companies regard public pressure and outcry as something that can be safely ignored.
