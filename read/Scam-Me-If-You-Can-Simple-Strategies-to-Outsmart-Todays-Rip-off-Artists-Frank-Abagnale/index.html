She was a methamphetamine addict. Law enforcement experts say there is a discernible link between meth addiction and ID theft. (Location 155)</p><p>Experts say the effects of fraud on individuals are similar to the psychological aftermath experienced by victims of violent crimes and war, ranging from anxiety to emotional volatility, depression to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (Location 163)</p><p>AARP, a nonprofit with thirty-seven million members. (Location 189)</p><p>I was tall, which made me appear older, nicely dressed, and very polite.

(Location 345)</p><p>Pop-up windows telling you that your computer has a virus are scams to get money and/or infect your computer with malicious and destructive software programs (Location 352)</p><p>Most passwords used by scammers are stolen—not guessed. Long, complex passwords are as easy to steal as short, simple ones (Location 354)</p><p>Share your photos after you come back—don’t signal on social media that you’re not home! (Location 356)</p><p>Avoid rental companies that require up-front fees and monthly membership dues to access listings of low-cost rentals, pre-foreclosure rentals, or rent-to-own properties. Most are scams. Moreover, if the landlord or agent wants a fee to show you the property, it’s a scam (Location 363)</p><p>It’s very easy to order any birth certificate from a county clerk’s office (Location 370)</p><a href=#the-playbook-exposed-recognizeand-beatthe-con-artists-game><h4 id=the-playbook-exposed-recognizeand-beatthe-con-artists-game><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Playbook Exposed: Recognize—and Beat—the Con Artist’s Game</h4></a><p>Once a con identifies your triggers, he uses them as part of the pitch to drive you to a heightened emotional state. (Location 424)</p><p>The con gathers an arsenal of information by being personable and being friendly (Location 427)</p><p>Once the emotions and memories come flooding into the target’s mind, the target connects those feelings to the person on the other end of the phone. (Location 436)</p><p>Never engage a stranger in dialogue about your personal life. (Location 440)</p><p>Scarcity, urgency, and flattery are three hot buttons often used together by scammers, unscrupulous salespeople, and others who want to talk their victims into agreeing to unfavorable deals. (Location 447)</p><p>Make it a nonnegotiable personal rule to give yourself one full day to think about any financial decision. This will diminish the emotion attached to the pitch and give you time to think without any pressure from anyone else. (Location 473)</p><p>limited-time offers are rarely legitimate. Even supermarkets put grocery items on sale in weekly rotation! If you don’t get the eggs on sale this week, you can get them on sale in a few weeks. (Location 490)</p><p>Don’t get swept up in desperation or quick fixes. Look for alternatives. (Location 510)</p><p>Big-win scams rely on outlandish claims presented in legitimate-sounding ways to get you under the ether. (Location 533)</p><p>Never agree to anything in an excited state. (Location 549)</p><p>The overarching principle that scam artists rely on is not a target’s lack of intelligence but how easy it is to manipulate a target’s emotional state to a place where trust is established. (Location 570)</p><p>As Robert Cialdini writes in Influence: Science and Practice, in a technologically advanced world where we are bombarded by information, we often fall back on a decision-making approach based on generalizations that allow us to act with a limited amount of thought and time.

How Identity Thieves Work</h4></a><p>When we use credit cards, we’re using the credit card company’s money, not ours. (Location 680)</p><p>“deep web”—a place that requires logins for the databases and websites found there. (Location 688)</p><p>Tor software was developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1990s so that intelligence agents operating overseas could communicate anonymously with colleagues in the United States. It was released to the public in 2003 as open software, (Location 694)</p><p>Shred anything that has your name and other identifying information about you: (Location 714)</p><p>The best shredders have “high-security micro-cut,” which means the shredder turns your mail into confetti. (Location 720)</p><p>Having multiple major credit cards can be a good strategy if you want to separate purchases into categories and save some money, but only if you pay the cards off on time. (Location 765)</p><p>If I do have to write a check, I use an inexpensive gel pen, because that ink cannot be washed off. Look for gel pens with specially formulated ink that becomes trapped in paper, which helps prevent criminal check washing and other document alterations. (Location 781)</p><p>Notify the police. In all likelihood, the police won’t do anything to recover your wallet, but you want a record of the theft. Have the police write up a report, and keep a copy; it provides you with a record for insurance and other purposes. (Location 801)</p><p>An initial fraud alert can make it harder for an identity thief to open more accounts in your name. When you have an alert on your report, a business must verify your identity before it issues you credit, so it may try to contact you for this purpose. (Location 816)</p><p>To prevent criminals from using facial recognition software to steal your image, avoid posting full-face photos, like passport photos, which make it easy to take the precise measurements that recognition software depends on. Instead, stick to group shots and angled poses so that it’s difficult to get those measurements. (Location 895)</p><p>A credit freeze (or security freeze) prevents a would-be identity thief from opening new credit cards in your name. It works by denying access to your credit reports, (Location 906)</p><p>it’s a good idea for everyone to freeze their credit for extra security. And it’s now very easy to do, because in September 2018, credit freezes became free in the United States.

Tax Fraud and IRS Scams</h4></a><p>Murfield then realized what had happened to her. But it was too late: $650 was gone for good. She filed a police report and called a local television station to tell her story, in hopes of helping others avoid the same scam. (Location 1002)</p><p>The IRS won’t call you before writing to you first. (Location 1005)</p><p>In 2018, the IRS issued a warning about a new twist on an old phone scam. In this one, criminals program their computers to display the TAC telephone number on your caller ID to convince you that you are getting an authentic call, (Location 1019)</p><p>The IRS never endorses a tax preparer or accountant. (Location 1090)</p><p>If a tax preparer pegs his fee to the amount of your refund, walk the other way. Accountants don’t work on percentages. They work either on an hourly basis or for a flat fee.

Sick: Medical Identity Theft</h4></a><p>If someone gains access to your medical files or insurance card and uses them to get services, you might receive improper care because the thief’s medical information can become mixed up with yours (Location 1170)</p><p>Security procedures are only as good as the people who implement, maintain, and monitor them. (Location 1260)</p><p>It wasn’t until 2015 that the government passed a law requiring that Medicare and Social Security numbers be different—something I lobbied hard for, as did AARP. (Location 1268)</p><p>Criminals are patient and have been known to wait five years or more to use stolen information, so credit monitoring and ID protection need to be done long-term. (Location 1294)</p><p>Training should be frequent and updated as new threats appear and new solutions are identified. Proper data security should be an integral requirement of every job that requires employee access to data, and employees should be evaluated on these criteria. (Location 1300)</p><p>Portable devices such as tablets, smartphones, and laptops are easily lost or stolen—and can be left in a place where an unauthorized user can help himself to information. (Location 1304)</p><p>Awareness is the best place to start, and businesses are paying more attention by looking for vulnerabilities in their computer systems, running mock scenarios, and holding employees to higher standards of accountability.

Protect Yourself Against These Bad Investments</h4></a><p>All investment involves risk, but promises of low risk with high returns is a huge red flag. (Location 1376)</p><p>Any investment tied to markets is likely to offer variable returns. Paperwork that indicates no variation in returns is another huge red flag. (Location 1379)</p><p>Registration provides investors with access to key information about the company’s management, products, services, and finances. (Location 1382)</p><p>Be suspicious if you do not receive a payment or have a hard time cashing out your investment. (Location 1394)</p><p>no decision on any financial investment should be made without researching it first. (Location 1437)</p><p>One way fraudsters gain the trust of group members is to persuade one person, perhaps in a leadership position, to buy into the investment. (Location 1473)</p><p>When trades are done for the benefit of the broker and not the client, that is called excessive trading, or churning. It’s not only unethical but illegal. Under the law, even one unnecessary trade can be considered churning. (Location 1477)</p><p>The safest plan may be to pay a credentialed financial adviser for a couple of hours of work to put together an insurance program that is right for you, especially when it comes to life, long-term (Location 1578)</p><p>To understand advisers’ credentials, how they are compensated, and what fiduciary obligation they have to you, you should ask a series of questions that they should be more than happy to answer. If they are hesitant, act offended, brush off questions, or try to change the subject, they could be scammers. (Location 1583)</p><p>If you just want someone to execute trades for you, you may not need a fiduciary. But if you want someone to manage your money with the highest standard of care, you may want to consider one.

Small Business Shakedowns</h4></a><p>You don’t owe anyone anything for a product that was sent unsolicited. You’re not even required to return it. You can refuse delivery of unsolicited goods, or you can accept delivery and keep or dispose of the item in any way you see fit. The law defines such items as unconditional gifts. (Location 1669)</p><p>Do not even click the X button on the pop-up to close these windows, because that is another way scammers can infect your computer with a virus. (Location 1801)</p><p>According to the IRS, W-2 email phishing scams are one of the most dangerous tax scams. (Location 1837)</p><p>If your business or organization receives a suspect email requesting W-2 data, report it immediately to the IRS. Send the full email to

I’m (Not Actually) from the Government: Social Security, Government Grants, and Other “Official” Scams</h4></a><p>One investigation revealed that half of the twenty most frequent lottery ticket winners in New Jersey were licensed lottery dealers or retailers, or family members of store owners. (Location 1998)</p><p>Don’t pay a fee to get a grant or sweepstakes winnings. (Location 2042)</p><p>we trust the government to have our best interests in mind.
