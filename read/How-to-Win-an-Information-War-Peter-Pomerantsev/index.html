Their lift and lilt gave me a thrill of exultation of which I felt quite ashamed. (Location 165)</p><p>For Delmer, this strain, this splitting of the self, will go on to become the source of his strength and skill. (Location 170)</p><p>Ever since they came to power, the Nazis have seen radio as the great force that can bind the country; break down the old divisions, the rifts among classes and regions; unite all Germans; and make real the grand claim of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels that with the arrival of the Nazis, “the individual will be replaced by the Community of the People”: (Location 181)</p><p>Even cheaper medium-wave radios could, with the help of a few choice wires acting as improvised antennas, be used to travel beyond the official stations of the Reich. (Location 195)</p><p>The Nazis knew this vulnerability. Tuning in to foreign broadcasts, and especially to the hated BBC, was a crime punishable by hanging. (Location 197)</p><p>He respected Hitler, who was the sort of man he had fought next to in World War I, but he accused Himmler, Göring, and the rest of being soft on Britain. (Location 213)</p><p>Der Chef was not a renegade Nazi. He was being played by a mild-mannered German novelist of Jewish descent. His adjutant was played by a German journalist, the son of one of Berlin’s greatest cabaret impresarios, who had fled the Nazis with his Jewish wife. (Location 246)</p><p>Gutsy fact-checkers who, sometimes at great personal risk, strive to establish the truth— but are ignored by the millions of people who don’t want to hear the truth. (Location 258)</p><p>The propagandists see this as a war in which information is a weapon you use not to win an abstract argument but to confuse, dismay, demoralize, and distract. It is a tool to tap into human fears, vulnerabilities, and secret, often violent and cruel desires and twist them to the benefit of the powerful forces they serve. (Location 260)</p><p>Delmer gathered around him artists, academics, spies, soldiers, astrologists, and forgers. (Location 269)</p><p>Delmer was convinced that his German experience meant he could understand the power of their propaganda— and its weakness. After the war, he tried to create a new type of media that could withstand the hate and lies he had seen dominate Germany, and he worried that despite the introduction of democracy, old propaganda habits could return. (Location 285)</p><p>Ultimately, propaganda and its influence over us pose the question of whether we can be truly free. When are you yourself, and when are you a being who has been manipulated by others? (Location 292)</p><p>The lessons Delmer has for us are positive, negative, and urgent. (Location 307)</p><p>Russians are in an “informational bunker,” Zelensky said— psychological as much as technological— refusing to accept responsibility and reality.

(Location 356)</p><p>In 2010 a leading German historian of World War I, Gerd Krumeich, studied other photos of the scene on the square and couldn’t find Hitler in any of them. He concluded that the image had been cut and pasted by Nazi propagandists in 1932, (Location 378)</p><p>When the war began, Professor Delmer’s Rektor had offered him a chance to naturalize and become a loyal subject of the kaiser. Delmer refused. (Location 388)</p><p>Frederick Delmer made Sefton and his sister speak German at home in order to understand the country that they lived in. (Location 407)</p><p>In the Prussia Sefton Delmer describes growing up in, people glorified and imitated the army. (Location 415)</p><p>letters between soldiers and their loved ones: letters about love, sacrifice, and bravery. These were intimate letters that real people had written, blurring the line between the private and the public, creating the sense that this was truly a people’s war. (Location 439)</p><p>with every new victory, Kantstraße would resound with celebration. Flags were unfurled from every window. Not just German flags but also Danish, Greek, Swiss, and American ones: even the foreigners wanted to join in Germany’s great triumphs. (Location 462)</p><p>The real power of propaganda is not to convince or even to confuse: it’s to give you a sense of belonging. (Location 475)</p><p>As Ellul wrote, “Propaganda is the true remedy for loneliness.” And the more we live in a society where we have little control over our lives, the more we need propaganda that gives us a sense of (ersatz) agency: (Location 493)</p><p>when Delmer would plot his response to Nazi propaganda, as with any counterpropaganda we may plan today, he knew that no effort would work unless it took into account this need to belong that propaganda satisfies, a need that he knew from his own vulnerability to it. (Location 518)</p><p>His urge to join in with the German songs, to unfurl the flag to celebrate German victories, is not in contrast to his being bullied, spurned, alienated— it’s the consequence of it. (Location 520)</p><p>“Reinhardt was convinced that in most people, and most actors, the real personality is buried deep inside under a thick layer of shyness, mannerisms and convention&mldr;. Accordingly, his conception of the actor’s task was never based on the idea that the actor is an impersonator who should assume another human being’s personality. For him the actor’s task was to use his own personality to the fullest possible extent to express the essence of the character he was portraying.” (Location 532)</p><p>Puns and word slippages are trapdoors out of the prison of propaganda— and Delmer would always be obsessed with them. (Location 562)</p><p>We have two ways of having a relationship with the language all around us, Delmer seems to be telling us. We can either be defined by it or rebel and re-create it. (Location 562)</p><p>A committee for refugees put them up in a greasy bedsit in a street of stuccoed houses whose white facades were grimy and stained with soot. (Location 613)</p><p>Frederick Delmer’s portrait of unhappy Germans went against the image of the enemy that had been cultivated in the British press. Ever since 1914, the British papers had evoked the image of a dreaded, unified, all-powerful Hun. (Location 627)</p><p>How do you deliver truth to people who are resistant to it? (Location 636)</p><p>I then headed out to Moscow because I had the freedom there to define my own way of being British— much as Delmer could in Berlin. (Location 685)</p><a href=#chapter-2-the-nazi-circus><h3 id=chapter-2-the-nazi-circus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 2 THE NAZI CIRCUS</h3></a><p>Max Reinhardt and Arthur Kahane were putting on plays that used the whole city as their stage, with performances in train stations and cathedrals, so that the borders between life and theater, between real and unreal, were ever more blurred. (Location 721)</p><p>Unlike during his wartime childhood, being English was now in demand: “I used to allow quite a bit of English accent to peep through in my German— in the hope that it would make me seem more romantic.” (Location 729)</p><p>The Berlin masquerade itself masked how the old desires for domination still lurked just below the surface, ready to be seduced by a more wild and malign performance. (Location 763)</p><p>The poster was ringed in red and black bands— the colors of the banned German imperial flag, which the Nazis had smuggled back in to public view on their innocent-seeming swastika banner. (Location 767)</p><p>“miracle man.” Berlin teemed with these salesmen-cum-saviors promising to restore German pride while also peddling financial pyramid schemes or magical food supplements that would make your muscles stronger and the nation invincible. Hitler was peddling another “miracle cure”: pure racial identity as a solution to all ills. (Location 776)</p><p>IT’S TEMPTING TO DISMISS leaders and movements with “crackpot” ideas. (Location 790)</p><p>The Nazis’ evidence-free claim to “purity” could be alluring in a time of disorienting change. In Weimar Germany, where social roles and norms were transforming as rapidly as new acts in a cabaret review, it promised a simple way of knowing who you were. (Location 798)</p><p>its very fragility provoked aggression against anyone who questioned it. (Location 800)</p><p>In the propaganda to justify the 2022 Russian invasion, this old myth was given a new twist: any Ukrainians who did not admit to being “one people” with Russia had to be eliminated so that only Ukrainians who understood that their “true” identity lay with Russia could remain. (Location 813)</p><p>Soon he would want to integrate the storm troopers into the official German army, and that would need approval from the victorious powers in World War I. (Location 836)</p><p>The Nazis’ aim would be to forge a unified Volksgemeinschaft (people’s community) from this fractured rabble. Delmer’s goal would become to divide them. (Location 851)</p><p>I would put a question. He would reply, and his reply would swell out into an oration, as more and more ideas flowed into his imaginative and highly articulate mind. Before anyone could pull him up, he would be shouting as though he had the Sports Palace crowd before him, not just a solitary British reporter.” 19 But as quickly as the oration swelled with passion, it was shut down, almost like a machine whose power is switched off, (Location 885)</p><p>Röhm, Delmer had by now realized, thought he was a British spy, and however much he tried to explain that he was not, the more Röhm was convinced he was: (Location 912)</p><p>To compensate for not being on the radio, Goebbels organized three thousand party meetings per day. Millions of handbills, brochures, and special editions of party newspapers were printed across the country. Goebbels filmed a ten-minute speech, which was projected in the open air in big cities and cinemas. He made a gramophone recording of his speech and printed fifty thousand copies. (Location 934)</p><p>Hitler would fly across the country giving forty-six speeches in ten days. (Location 943)</p><p>TO THE EXTENT THEY had a coherent theory of how propaganda works, Goebbels and Hitler were informed by the writing of the French sociologist Gustave Le Bon. (Location 947)</p><p>We often wonder why people follow leaders who are wildly self-centered, greedy, and hateful. But that can be the very essence of their power: they allow their followers to indulge in their most cruel and hateful impulses, even as they foster the illusion that they are part of a noble and courageous spiritual mission. “They legitimize, surface, articulate, and elevate all the horrid things we yearn to indulge in.” (Location 969)</p><p>Hitler himself, like other evangelists before and after him, lived on the emotion and mass hysteria he produced in his audiences, sucking it into himself as he orated, then spewing it out again at them with compound interest. (Location 1010)</p><p>We are all, Money-Kyrle argued, more than ready to embrace the language of grievance because it gives us the chance to blame external forces for all the things we don’t like about ourselves. (Location 1045)</p><p>Hitler’s power stemmed not so much from his ability to win people over with clever arguments, but from his articulating the feelings that already lay within them and taking them on an emotional journey from feeling humiliated to humiliating others. (Location 1048)</p><p>Viewed in an unfavourable light, propaganda often seems to be a method of inducing a series of temporary psychoses, often starting with depression and passing, via paranoia, to a state of manic bliss.” (Location 1051)</p><p>The great paradox is that the Kremlin is the cause of many Russians’ historical and current humiliations— just as the Chinese Communist Party has been for the Chinese. (Location 1068)</p><p>In the logic of this political psychology, the “strong hand” first humiliates, that humiliation is then celebrated as necessary and even ennobling, and the humiliation is then taken out on others. (Location 1079)</p><p>The pose of victimhood is a mask under which to hurt others. When the powerful claim they are being humiliated, they’re stating what they actually want to do to you. (Location 1083)</p><p>A few weeks before the invasion, he casually invoked a Russian rape joke to explain what he would do to Ukraine. (Location 1091)</p><p>From his seat inside the airplane, Delmer could observe Hitler in his moment of transformation from tired traveling salesman to the Führer who channeled the nation’s darkest feelings. (Location 1111)</p><p>“As I see it, Hitler’s personal tragedy and through him that of his country was that he came to believe in his act. He accepted as truth his own skilfully built propaganda myth that he was the miraculously infallible Führer Lightgod.” (Location 1117)</p><p>Delmer’s view of our relationship to propaganda. We’re always somehow parroting it. We’re rarely completely hypnotized, or not for long. We are not just brainwashed “zombies” but conscious actors in a performance. People are slightly faking their fanaticism— and their fascist leaders are also somewhat fake. (Location 1138)</p><p>Did you hear that click in the receiver now after I started talking to you? That click is the reason why so many people in Berlin will not talk candidly over the phone. Little birds, they say, are clicking in and listening to all they say. (Location 1164)</p><p>I retained special permission from the police that everyone should be allowed to place loudspeakers in the open windows of their houses. Germany will be forced to hear Hitler. (Location 1190)</p><p>The Nazis spread the story that the fire was part of a vast left-wing conspiracy. The country, they cried, was in mortal danger. They prompted the aging Hindenburg to pass the Reichstag Fire Decree: the government now had the right to arrest anyone without charge, dissolve political organizations, ban publications, and overrule local laws. Germany was a dictatorship. (Location 1194)</p><p>“This was a story,” he writes of his approach, “and a reporter will shake hands with the devil himself on a story.” (Location 1215)</p><p>He would return in summer 1934 to catch the “Night of the Long Knives”: Hitler’s bloody purge of Röhm and the storm troopers, (Location 1226)</p><p>Bruce Lockhart’s judgment was important: in World War II he would become director of the Political Warfare Executive. He was the sort of man Delmer needed to win over if he was to make full use of his experience. (Location 1278)</p><a href=#chapter-3-not-reliable><h3 id=chapter-3-not-reliable><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER 3 NOT RELIABLE</h3></a><p>Goebbels, who had planned the speech’s strategy along with Hitler’s diplomats, wanted Hitler’s peace offer to split the British government and the British public. (Location 1324)</p><p>All of his past was coming together to have meaning, purpose, patriotism. When Cooper asked him to lecture on the German BBC, it felt “like being given a knighthood.” (Location 1382)</p><p>Instead of him being welcomed in as “one of us,” stool pigeons were sent to test him.

(Location 3434)</p><p>The day they left, the Russian soldiers grabbed everything they could from the village. The tanks were piled high with mattresses and pink suitcases, the armored vehicles stuffed full of bedsheets, toys, and washing machines. (Location 3447)</p><p>AS THE WAR WORSENED for the Nazis, Joseph Goebbels was also trying to make sacrifice more attractive. (Location 3468)</p><p>He advanced the view that there were two principal wishes involved in what he labeled “war neuroses”: “the wish for death and the wish for a wound&mldr;. Those who suffer from anxiety states have wished for death during the period of strain and fatigue preceding the final collapse&mldr; or for some disabling illness.” (Location 3496)</p><p>In the 1930s, as in the 2020s, Ukrainians were seen as emblematic of people dying so that their cause might live. (Location 3514)</p><p>“The notion of a great military victory had passed into the background while he poses more as a martyr, the speech ending on the theme of his death.” (Location 3528)</p><p>Any plan to undermine the allure of the Nazis’ appeal to sacrifice had, first of all, to position itself as part of a positive collective mission, had to be somehow a part of your duty to your fellow Germans; second, it had to restore your sense of being able to act and overcome the desire to just sink into passive acceptance of your demise.

(Location 3567)</p><p>Delmer’s “dead letters” and food hampers from hell were being delivered by a network of underground agents throughout Europe. (Location 3621)</p><p>When they killed a German, they should make it look like it was done by a German resistance movement.

(Location 3756)</p><p>The BBC, Delmer rued in his memoirs, was “stopped from saying anything to encourage the rebels, they were specifically ordered to announce that His Majesty’s Government was not prepared to absolve the army from its responsibility for the war or to differentiate Germans and Germans. All were responsible. The only terms on which Germany could have peace were— as before— unconditional capitulation.” (Location 3776)</p><p>The botched assassination had the opposite effect from what the conspirators and Delmer hoped: it united the army and the party. (Location 3780)</p><p>“Fanatical” had been one of the negative terms given a positive spin by the Nazis, an insult they had remodeled as something to aspire to. (Location 3785)</p><p>In terms of propaganda they have drawn something rousing, a mood of victory out of a most serious defeat, millions will once more believe in final victory.” (Location 3814)</p><p>All high-level officers of course knew that the Sender was British but saw in it a message that Delmer claims to have planted on purpose, that a revolt against Hitler would lead to a peace deal with the Allies. “Such a separate peace was of course out of the question,” (Location 3834)</p><p>German soldiers on the Western Front, the target of Delmer’s media, did desert and surrender in droves, unlike those on the Eastern Front. (Location 3858)</p><p>Both sides were pretending that a Sender rumor was true in order to give the Germans an honorable way to surrender. (Location 3867)</p><p>propaganda for Delmer was about giving people the excuse to do what they secretly desired anyway. (Location 3868)</p><p>The effectiveness of propaganda, or counterpropaganda, indeed of any communication, depends on how well you understand your audience. (Location 3881)</p><p>He conducted and reviewed more than six hundred interviews with POWs and concluded that “the psychology of Nazis, as disclosed by detailed individual investigation of large numbers of them and subsequent statistical validation, fails to show gross mental disorder. It is characterised by an unconscious over-emphasis of paternal authority, evasion of responsibility by blaming scape-goats, over-valuation of masculinity, and depreciation of feminine and tender influences.” (Location 3885)</p><p>The ensuing weak sense of individual agency led to a search for strong leaders and identification with an all-encompassing, abstract nation/ family. (Location 3890)</p><p>Irrational spurts of aggression were a way to deal with the sense of inadequacy. (Location 3892)</p><p>“If primary narcissism is structural and necessary,” explains Josh Cohen, “and is basically our investment in our own self-preservation, secondary narcissism involves specific character traits and habits— vanity, self-inflation, superiority, all of course masking an underlying fear of one’s own inadequacy.” (Location 3895)</p><p>propaganda exploits vulnerabilities and anxieties that can originate in childhood and persist throughout our lives.

He had learned the cadences of Goebbels’s speeches and where the propaganda minister would leave little pauses and gaps.

(Location 4044)</p><p>In farthest west Germany, where the Americans and British were breaking through, the Allies had both air superiority and superiority over the airwaves: it was almost impossible to receive German broadcasts. (Location 4070)</p><p>Goebbels’s reliance on people’s fear of Soviet atrocities to inspire resistance in the East was having the opposite effect on the Western Front— wouldn’t surrender to the Allies be preferable to occupation by the Soviets? (Location 4091)</p><p>It was amusing to observe how isolated and crumbling scraps of NLI [Nazi language], which had been dutifully learned by heart, still floated around like islands in the man’s disillusioned and embittered head. (Location 4102)</p><p>The British government had a different job for Delmer: create a new media system in Germany. It was a chance to ensure that Germany didn’t repeat the same cycle as after the previous war: (Location 4117)</p><p>Delmer recalled how the exposure of British propaganda in World War I was then used by Nazi propaganda to claim, falsely, that the German loss had been brought about by mere “tricks and lies” and not by military defeat, (Location 4127)</p><p>On April 30, Hitler had shot himself. On May 1, Goebbels and his wife had killed themselves after poisoning their six children. (Location 4140)</p><p>Throughout the country, the rubble was being slowly cleared by hand.

(Location 4163)</p><p>Whether this controversy played the decisive role or not, Delmer’s grand schemes were scrapped, and he was offered the much more truncated position of just running the newswire. He quit.

(Location 4324)</p><p>Climbing up high always inspires a sense of possibilities. (Location 4340)</p><p>In the 1960s and 1970s a generation of young Germans finally rebelled. There were bloody protests on Germany’s streets opposing the inclusion of former Nazis in leading positions in government and business. School programs explored Germany’s fixation with authoritarianism. German and European films revealed the fascist relationship to sadomasochism.

(Location 4385)</p><p>They manipulate the desire to belong; provide a sense of false community to those left feeling deracinated by rapid change; help project our worst feelings about ourselves onto others; allow you to feel special, even superior, and foster the sense that you are surrounded by enemies that want to take something from you, something that’s yours and only yours and only you deserve. (Location 4388)</p><p>What is at stake is whether we can create a communication environment where democracy can function, or whether other systems are more efficient in the new information era.

(Location 4438)</p><p>if propaganda is the remedy for loneliness, we need to provide a better cure. (Location 4443)</p><p>Through these four processes— creating media communities stronger than the propagandists’; breaking the propagandists’ monopoly on expressing the darkest feelings; making people aware of how Nazi social roles were a ghoulish cabaret you could discard; and provoking people to behave more independently— Delmer created a distance between the German people and the Nazi propaganda. (Location 4462)</p><p>So much of contemporary propaganda is designed to make you feel overwhelmed by the amount of confusing content out there, undermine the difference between truth and lies, and through this confusion find relief by placing your faith in a leader who reduces the world into crass conspiracies.

So much about him revolved around the need to simultaneously belong— and yet also express his uniqueness.
