The problem is that it often attracts the wrong people, and drives away other folks who might be great at it, if they only knew the facts.

My teacher Kevin did an amazing semester on the stock market, where he had us pair up. My buddy Cooper and I created a dummy portfolio and each day we’d chart the prices in class and discuss the stocks. (Location 222)</p><p>thing you can do as a foundation for day trading. You should want to explore trading through genuine curiosity about learning it, and not from the pressure of putting food on the table. (Location 302)</p><p>these services wouldn’t teach you to develop your own strategy, because it would be bad for their business model. (Location 325)</p><p>In my second year, I lost everything that I had made in the first year. (Location 338)</p><p>Following the Great Recession of 2007-2009, many people had a deep loathing for the big Wall Street banks that brought the financial system to its knees. (Location 363)</p><p>it was now just me and my dog. I cut firewood and also cut every expense I could think of. I made Craigslist ads for stuff in my barn— stuff that I didn’t really need. Through all of this, I was able to buy myself some time and extend that runway. (Location 375)</p><p>A “swing trade” is where you hold a stock for days or weeks, (Location 383)</p><p>During the time my account was offline, I had time to think. One thing I believe I’ve always been good at is figuring stuff out, instead of just throwing the whole thing out the window. (Location 411)</p><p>What was I doing differently when I made money, from when I lost it? (Location 421)</p><p>there were times a stock could make big moves due simply to a “technical breakout” or a “short squeeze” where the stock performed outside of expected parameters and traders took notice. I decided that focusing on stocks with news would be better, but eventually I might be able to trade stocks without news if they proved they were strong. (Location 432)</p><p>shares available to trade. This is called the float, and lower float stocks are more volatile than ones with a higher float. (Location 436)</p><p>Following an IPO, a company can do secondary offerings to sell more shares; this is a form of dilution and generally reduces the stock price. Companies can also conduct share buybacks or reverse splits. Both effectively reduce the number of shares available to trade. (Location 438)</p><p>High demand and limited supply creates an imbalance, which leads to momentum and volatility. This is what real day traders are looking for. (Location 446)</p><p>Trading a little of everything can be good early on because you’ll discover what strategies match your risk tolerance and personality. (Location 456)</p><p>Based on my self analysis, my best trades were on stocks that were up over 10 percent, had high relative volume, had some type of breaking news, were priced between $ 2 and $ 20, and had a float of fewer than 50 million shares. (Location 465)</p><p>I would be green, then I would give back half of my profit and would keep trading; I would hold past my max loss on a trade and hope it bounced back; I would average down on a trade (adding to a loser); I would trade past the maximum daily loss amount I’d previously set as a boundary; I’d trade even after having three consecutive losers, a red flag that should have told me to stop; I’d revenge trade, where I tried to make up for previous bad trades by jumping prematurely into another; (Location 486)</p><p>I’d then get furious at what just happened to that last trade and would FOMO in long at the very top (FOMO is “fear of missing out” and I’d buy at the top— when the signals told me not to— just in case it was going higher). (Location 491)</p><p>I was bad at walking away when I was having a bad day, and it was costing me a lot of money. (Location 494)</p><p>successful traders did not trade for ten hours a day. The focus and discipline to be ON— to be watching a stock second by second intently— simply could not be done for ten hours a day. (Location 498)</p><p>I got into a routine, kept myself busy, and I felt very productive. In fact, it almost felt like therapy, because I was in control of my tiny little world: (Location 504)</p><p>When I saw it clearly, I was going big. Get green, and shut it down. If I didn’t see it, I wasn’t touching it. (Location 518)</p><p>focus on the gap scanner each day. This screen showed me which stocks were set to open the highest relative to where they closed the previous day. (Location 530)</p><p>Traders flock to the top ten gappers. (Location 532)</p><p>I wait for a stock to start to move, and then I jump in. I wait for it to prove itself: not that it’ll necessarily be the next Apple, but that today, it has the potential to squeeze up 20-30 percent or more. (Location 545)</p><p>It’s true that you’re battling a little with other traders to get in before the next guy, so to speak. But for a lot of these stocks, I’ve found that there is enough volume and enough trades for many small traders like me to participate. (Location 557)</p><p>there is more to be gained by chatting with the right sort of people than there is a risk that you’ll somehow give away your edge. After all, we’re little traders (Location 564)</p><p>Except before I actually sent him the money, I had a little bit of a funny feeling. I decided to do some digging. (Location 575)</p><p>This application of rules to historical data is known as “back testing.” (Location 608)</p><p>Back-tested results captured a few details about how the markets performed, but they did not record the extraordinary complexity of the minute-by-minute market. (Location 613)</p><p>the stock market is like a flowing river. You’re standing there, in the river, with your fishing rod. You cast the rod intending to land your hook and bait in a certain spot, but you end up being one foot south of the spot you were looking at. (Location 618)</p><p>The stock market operates in intervals of milliseconds (one thousandth of a second) and microseconds (one millionth of a second). (Location 621)</p><p>I also get clarity from putting my thoughts into words. (Location 640)</p><p>I never found a resource with this sort of focus just on day trading when I was starting out. Even though my website was new, I began to rank well in Google for very specific keywords (Location 648)</p><p>I can take part in the crazy high-tech world of minute-by-minute day trading, while looking out my window at a backyard filled with birds, chipmunks, and the occasional fox. (Location 675)</p><p>What makes sense for anyone wanting to try to trade like me is to mimic the principles and techniques I use to trade, including the strategy, the tools, what to look for, problems to avoid, and so on. (Location 705)</p><p>Each of us is dealt a set of strong and weak cards. What counts is whether you decide to throw away the weak cards, get some new ones, and how you play that hand. Luck and skill will decide the outcome. (Location 710)</p><p>I focus on stocks with the following characteristics: Up over 10 percent on the day versus the previous day’s closing price. High relative volume (at least 2.0). Share prices are between $ 2 and $ 10, and not more than $ 20. News or some other catalyst is announced today. Relatively low float and therefore greater volatility (preferably twenty million shares or fewer). (Location 723)</p><p>we have a bunch of preconceptions and misconceptions about day trading that can get in the way of learning about how best to approach this business.

(Location 776)</p><p>by first reducing your risk, you can begin the process of developing strategy and discipline in a safe environment. (Location 787)</p><p>Learning how the human emotions of fear and greed translate into price action is critical to your ability to profitably trade the markets. You need to capitalize on emotions in the market without falling victim to your own emotions. (Location 825)</p><p>it’s not the news stories that change the price of the stock. Changes in stock price are because of changes in supply and demand. (Location 829)</p><p>What the news does is affect the emotions of traders, who then act on their fear, greed, suspicions, intuition, pride, and other strong emotions. (Location 831)</p><p>Only when you’re consistently doing at least OK should you even think about using real money. No matter how good you were in the simulator, you’ll discover that trading with real money is different, so there’ll be an adjustment phase. (Location 859)</p><p>for the most part we’re anticipating what a bunch of other humans will be thinking, feeling, and acting on in the next five to ten minutes. (Location 869)</p><p>How to get continuously better at recognizing patterns you’ve seen before, at seeing new patterns, and at ignoring extraneous stuff. (Location 881)</p><p>The trading simulator is like the driving instructor, making sure you don’t get wrecked. Trading in a $ 500 account is like driving your first car. You’ll make beginner mistakes, but the damage is minimal in a small account. Spend all the time you need in that safe environment where the stakes are low. (Location 904)</p><p>the vast majority of trades occur in the first few hours of trading, from 7: 30 am to 11: 30 am Eastern Time.

So at home I have four stocks that I’m watching, and one that I’m trading. (Location 1020)</p><p>I should have used a simulator and proven that I could be profitable there before ever risking a dime of real money. (Location 1037)</p><p>Traders who come into the market needing to make money quickly will typically speed through the process, put undue pressure on themselves, and begin a rapid downward spiral. (Location 1045)</p><p>Otto Von Bismarck, the German statesman, said: “Fools say ‘experience is the best teacher.’ I prefer to learn from other people’s experience.” (Location 1060)</p><p>Find a group that’s led by people who can prove that they’re successful at day trading, and not people who simply brag with no proof.

(Location 1131)</p><p>Each exchange has its own rules about the types of companies that can issue stock.

If that number is more than $ 10 billion, it’s called a large-cap stock. If it’s from $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion, then it’s called a mid-cap. And if it’s between $ 300 million and less than $ 2 billion, it’s a small-cap stock. (Location 1185)</p><p>Minimum spreads are regulated by exchanges. The rule states that stocks priced over $ 1.00 must be quoted in increments of no less than 1 cent. (Location 1210)</p><p>active traders will notice a phenomenon where stocks can move slowly when they are 85 or 95 cents a share, but as soon as they cross $ 1.00 they can move much faster. (Location 1217)</p><p>A tight spread indicates a higher volume battle between buyers and sellers and is typically associated with consolidation and periods of lower volatility. (Location 1219)</p><p>A wide spread typically reflects low participation of buyers and sellers. (Location 1220)</p><p>if a stock with a wide spread has breaking news, the wide spread combined with higher relative volume can actually fuel volatility. (Location 1222)</p><p>To profit from the frequent buyers and sellers, large institutional investors become registered to serve as market makers. This is a business of arbitrage. (Location 1226)</p><p>Competition among market makers— combined with higher participation from traders— create tighter spreads. (Location 1229)</p><p>when stocks experience heightened volatility, the algorithms turn off: market makers close up shop to manage their risk. This is when day traders can step in to capitalize on volatility without competing against the institutional traders. (Location 1236)</p><p>I don’t love to see a stock with a 1-cent spread, nor do I like to see a stock with a 50-cent spread. There is a sweet spot. More than anything else, what I look for is a fast rate of change. I want to see a stock moving up quickly. Once a stock is moving over 10 percent on the day— and certainly if it’s trading more than 5-10 percent in the last 10-15 minutes— we will see algorithms turn off and volatility spike. Spreads may get bigger, perhaps 10-15 cents on a stock under $ 20, (Location 1238)</p><p>Liquidity comes in the form of market makers posting orders to buy and sell shares, as well as individual investors placing orders. (Location 1248)</p><p>Publicly traded companies have an investor-relations department that not only does regulatory filings but also handles publicity and news releases. (Location 1257)</p><p>Ultimately, the substance of the news headline does matter. Over the course of hours, and certainly over days and weeks, the market will begin to align with the correct value of the company. However, in the moments when news is breaking, and during periods of heightened volatility, stocks can become very disconnected from their true market value. (Location 1264)</p><p>It is not the current value of a company that creates its stock market price. Traders and market participants buy up a stock based on the perceived future value of that company. (Location 1273)</p><p>That you, as a beginner, will be offered a margin account by your broker should not be interpreted as a recommendation to trade on margin.
