Though these empires are long gone, traces of them remain in our unique Ukrainian culture, in our proud identity as a multiethnic, multireligious European nation.

(Location 98)</p><p>Having amassed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in the previous ten months (Location 109)</p><p>little had been communicated to our citizens about what to do in the event the Russians actually invaded. (Location 116)</p><p>I had seen his courage when I had accompanied him on trips to visit soldiers on the front lines in Donbas, during the ongoing conflict there. He would insist on going to the most forward, dangerous positions, to chat with soldiers and shake their hands as the shells landed nearby. (Location 119)</p><p>The comment ricocheted around the globe, galvanized Ukrainians, and earned the world’s admiration. (Location 123)</p><p>It was a monumental achievement after seventy years of Communist rule. For me, it meant that, suddenly, overnight, I no longer had to grow up with limited choices. Instead, I could believe that anything was possible, if I was willing to work hard. (Location 160)</p><p>Holodomor, a Soviet state-sponsored famine in the 1930s that killed millions, (Location 170)</p><p>Psychologists Carol Dweck and Lauren Howe at Stanford University have written about the “trauma of the rejected”: how, after rejection, a person may question his or her own right to exist. (Location 176)</p><p>Ukrainians resemble those timid pupils. Our lack of confidence is in response to the numerous attempts to erase Ukraine as a nation. The time has come for us to have faith in ourselves. (Location 179)</p><p>David-and-Goliath struggle for freedom and democracy.

(Location 204)</p><p>perfectionism that he had shown in his past TV production work, asking his team to shoot scenes over and over again, was now evident in how he oversaw our office’s output of news, photos, and videos (Location 211)</p><p>Western partners. They always grumbled about providing the next tranche of funding to Ukraine, but they knew that they could not abandon a country of forty million people in the heart of Europe. (Location 221)</p><p>Becoming more like Europe remained beyond reach for us without European-style politicians. (Location 256)</p><p>The political elite had long since become rotten, and a change of faces changed nothing. (Location 258)</p><p>for Western observers, Ukraine was identified with the peasantry and remained in their minds a post-Soviet province. (Location 270)</p><p>It was art imitating life and life imitating art at the same time, (Location 278)</p><p>The TV show aired weekly, right up to the election, and it functioned as a showcase for Zelenskyy’s political ideas. (Location 279)</p><p>he wanted her to be there with him at those crucial moments, his partner in all things. (Location 287)</p><p>He also learned what it meant to debate in public without a teleprompter, a skill he soon mastered, thanks to his many years of stage experience. (Location 292)</p><p>I observed among my family members that Zelenskyy aroused feelings of compassion— an almost parental desire to protect him. (Location 296)</p><p>We all wanted to live better. And if not better, then at least we wanted to live with hope, not without it. (Location 317)</p><p>These social media stratagems manipulate our greatest fears and historical traumas; they elicit painful emotions and secretly inflate them with the intent of aggressively turning one group in society against another. (Location 329)</p><p>In Ukraine in 2019, the themes used to divide people were patriotism, language, and the question of whether to side with Western Europe or Russia in the continent’s ongoing conflicts. (Location 333)</p><p>In Ukraine, people were fed up with the kinds of controversies that almost all the country’s political forces had deliberately stirred up since 2002. These strategies were devastatingly familiar to us— we didn’t have a single political campaign in which attempts were not made to divide Ukrainians.

This will be uncomfortable for me, I will not hide that; it will depress me. But depression and discomfort will not influence my decisions. I will bury all of that inside me; there must be reforms. We have a chance. (Location 351)</p><p>Poverty means being unable to pay for an education, or a home, or clothing, or food, or to travel to other places and experience the world. To be poor is to be trapped in your confined world without the ability to learn something new or develop as a person. (Location 355)</p><p>Every person has two wings; one is physical, the other is spiritual. If a person is not utilizing the first, the physical, by working, the second, too, will be unable to function. Without the second wing, you won’t fly far on just one. (Location 361)</p><p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, there were no organized sports, so there was little else to do but fight other adolescents. (Location 366)</p><p>Even as an adult, and now as president, he still felt the need to prove to them that he was doing the right thing. (Location 377)</p><p>To some degree, their opposition to material goods was part of an intergenerational conflict that was widespread in post-Soviet families. (Location 382)</p><p>He was a meritocrat by nature and relentless about proving himself. (Location 392)</p><p>Olena had to browbeat acquaintances to come to those first student performances (Location 398)</p><p>He was a perfectionist during rehearsals, making the actors repeat their lines over and over again until they were flawless. (Location 404)</p><p>The deck was stacked against up-and-comers from the provinces, even though, after the fall of the Soviet Union, these provinces were no longer provinces but independent nations. (Location 419)</p><p>he could not imagine abandoning his team. He returned with them to Ukraine to build his production company there. (Location 428)</p><p>he worked as a producer for Inter, the biggest TV channel in Ukraine; created many movies and TV series; and became the beloved voice of Paddington Bear in the films, musicals, and cartoons. (Location 436)</p><p>Zelenskyy won accolades as a dancer in pairs competitions. (Location 437)</p><p>Zelenskyy’s humor always included a frontal attack on corrupt politicians and on social injustice. (Location 441)</p><p>Zelenskyy’s humor was targeted to a popular audience. In fact, Kvartal 95 relied on burlesque and often on raunchy humor. (Location 446)</p><p>The songs Zelenskyy and his troupe sang at the end of their show usually made people tear up with feelings of love for their homeland and pride in their nationality. (Location 453)</p><p>And right after that line, Zelenskyy assumed the role of Kabaeva herself, dressed all in pink and angry at the Russian president for coming home late. (Location 457)</p><p>Kvartal 95 made Zelenskyy a star. But it also gave him the opportunity to grow as a leader and a manager (Location 463)</p><p>Zelenskyy was also regularly invited to perform for private audiences— it was a way to earn money in the entertainment industry— and in doing that, he met a lot of powerful people, including politicians and tycoons. (Location 464)</p><p>It was true he had learned how to make a decent living for himself and his family, but could he help all Ukrainians do the same? (Location 475)</p><p>Honcharuk’s technocratic nature made it difficult for him to connect with people. (Location 487)</p><p>Zelenskyy drank endless cups of coffee and didn’t seem to need much sleep. Rising very early, he was in the habit of making work calls between 6: 00 and 7: 00 a.m. (Location 504)</p><p>One thing Zelenskyy did every day, everywhere he went, almost without exception was exercise. (Location 508)</p><p>In Ukraine, there are many religions, though Christianity has the largest number of adherents. (Location 526)</p><p>President Zelenskyy asked the minister of health at the time, Zoryana Skaletska, if she would quarantine herself in the resort for two weeks with the returnees from China (Location 539)</p><p>As a political manager, he had yet to learn to walk the line between making excuses and explaining what was happening. (Location 558)</p><p>One of Zelenskyy’s biggest problems was the lack of people with the necessary expertise and experience. (Location 560)</p><p>a crucial vote in late March to lift the moratorium on buying and selling farmland in Ukraine, which up till then could only be inherited (Location 591)</p><p>By the end of 2020, there was not a single politician in Ukraine anywhere close to Zelenskyy in terms of popularity.

That is how my post-Soviet generation was brought up for decades, still under the influence of the values of the USSR (Location 642)</p><p>Fear, obedience, monotony— but it was something that I naturally and intuitively could not accept. (Location 658)</p><p>I would recommend visiting the regional hospital, where my mom and dad work, and grabbing five at a time. (Location 663)</p><p>In the spring of 2022, I planned to go to Kherson with the intention of feeding these tart cakes to my fiancé, Pavlo, as part of an introduction to my childhood. (Location 664)</p><p>My mother gave all the money she had for these lessons— in the early 1990s, they cost an unbelievable amount: $ 5 an hour. (Location 682)</p><p>The war changed us, revealing our ideals and talents. (Location 723)</p><p>I don’t know about the rest of Poland, but at the end of 2014, Poles in Gdańsk viewed Ukraine as a heroic country. (Location 737)</p><p>I had never been really interested in any career for its own sake. I simply tried to do the best I could in each job I had, taking every opportunity to learn as much as possible. (Location 742)</p><p>We did live broadcasts from our phones and carried the equipment for them in little blue backpacks. (Location 760)</p><p>After the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Yanukovych went into exile in Russia, and his house was turned into a museum of corruption. (Location 773)</p><p>The article took about two months to research, and I uncovered some interesting stuff. (Location 778)</p><p>Everyone would be better off if the system could be made more formal and transparent, so that instead of paying bribes, people [would] pay taxes and the state could fund services,” Orttung added. “Of course, few want to pay taxes because they do not trust the state to provide good services.” (Location 799)</p><p>My professor was told that if he didn’t agree to sue to “recover his honor and dignity,” he would be fired. So he sued. (Location 810)</p><p>each of us should fight for our values any way we can. (Location 813)</p><p>it still was not professional enough.
