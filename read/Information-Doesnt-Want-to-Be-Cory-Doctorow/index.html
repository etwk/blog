So he took the piracy as advertising, and toured the U.S. in theaters, reading from his books. He made money, and he saw America. (Location 155)</p><p>Mammals, he said, and I paraphrase here and do not put it as well as Cory did, invest a great deal of time and energy in their young, in the pregnancy, in raising them. Dandelions just let their seeds go to the wind, and do not mourn the seeds that do not make it. Until now, creating intellectual content for payment has been a mammalian idea. Now it’s time for creators to accept that we are becoming dandelions.

(Location 205)</p><p>People actually like supporting the artists whose work they like. It makes them feel happy. You don’t have to force them. And if you force them, they don’t feel as good.

We don’t know exactly what it will look like or how it will function, but as long as human beings enjoy trafficking in the commerce of art and information, it is possible. (Location 235)</p><p>By putting laws into place that stop the free flow of information, sounds, and images, you mute the possibility of a real, authentic exchange. You take control out of the hands of the content creator, and out of the hands of the public, who can no longer decide whether or not they want to offer their support. (Location 239)</p><p>agony. (Location 249)</p><p>This is the lesson I learned, as a rock star and as a street performer in my wedding dress: • Keep the content authentic, • keep the exchange honest, • keep the message spreading by any means necessary, • and people will come. • Once they come, if you make it easy for them, many will pay. (Location 256)</p><p>Trying to protect a system that’s now fundamentally broken is like trying to reroute a raincloud to go and thunderstorm over a different town. You’re better off dealing with the facts, and grabbing your umbrella. Or, if you’re like many of the people I know: stripping naked and running around in the street, screaming with joy, and enjoying the downpour.

INTRODUCTION Detente</h3></a><p>at the turn of the twentieth century, composers were forced to defend their own turf— they called performers pirates, and insisted that recording music was a form of theft. (Location 285)</p><p>When we’re talking about copyright, we’re fundamentally talking about four different activities: making creative works, investing in creative works, distributing and selling creative works, and enjoying creative works. (Location 309)</p><p>some of the most dedicated audiences are made of up creators themselves (which is why authors are usually photographed standing in front of a wall of other people’s books).

Succeeding in business requires that you avoid this madness. One particular strain of madness is the overwhelming, irrational concern that you might be letting someone benefit from your work for free— what an economist would call “aversion to positive externalities.” (Location 325)</p><p>wellspring (Location 344)</p><p>“Jam yesterday; jam tomorrow; no jam today.” That is, we used to have jam, before everything changed, and we’re told there will be even more jam in the future. But right now, there is no jam.

(Location 361)</p><p>Pretty much everyone who ever set out to earn a living (or part of a living) in the arts failed. (Location 379)</p><p>The single most important thing you need in order to have a career in the arts is persistence. The second most important thing you need is talent. The third most important thing is a grounding in how the the online world works. (Location 394)</p><p>if I’m wrong, I promise that I’ll be wrong in a well-informed and interesting way.

These signatories go on to pass national laws that reflect their obligations under these treaties.

(Location 455)</p><p>there’s an “algorithm”— a mathematical system for scrambling the text. These algorithms are usually public and well understood, because no one is ever sure if an algorithm is secure until all her peers get a chance to look at it and check it over for flaws. (Location 469)</p><p>Because anti-circumvention rules mean that only a digital lock’s maker can authorize you to open it, on-the-fly conversions to improve compatibility often aren’t allowed. That’s how copyright ceases to protect creative works and begins to protect digital locks instead. (Location 492)</p><a href=#12-is-this-copyright-protection><h4 id=12-is-this-copyright-protection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.2 Is This Copyright Protection?</h4></a><p>Digital locks are roach motels: copyrighted works check in, but they don’t check out. Creators and investors lose control of their business— they become commodity suppliers for a distribution channel that calls all the shots. Anti-circumvention isn’t copyright protection: it’s middleman protection. (Location 531)</p><p>As Brewster tells it, Microsoft spent years waving one hand over its head, shouting, “Look out! Pirates! Pirates!” In the other hand, it held the knife. (Location 555)</p><p>Amazon offered the labels a lateral move: give up on digital rights management (DRM) software and sell your music as “unprotected” MP3s (Location 572)</p><a href=#13-so-is-this-copy-protection><h4 id=13-so-is-this-copy-protection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.3 So Is This Copy Protection?</h4></a><p>an Internet meme called “Now you’ve got two problems.” As in: “Your shower broke, and you decided to fix it yourself instead of calling a plumber.

(Location 619)</p><p>if publishers do succeed in convincing readers that books are just like CDs and DVDs, then the sight of a book in a shredder will have no more emotional kick than the sight of an old, scratched CD in the gutter, and publishers will lose all the social value they currently get for free. (Location 627)</p><p>“Never underestimate the determination of a kid who is cash-poor and time-rich.” (Location 636)</p><p>There was a weird Keystone Kops moment when the big studios and their technology partners tried to prevent publication of the 09 F9 key— every time they did, it made the news, and affronted Internet users republished it somewhere else. Soon, there were millions of copies of the number. (Location 663)</p><p>Job done. Ed Felten (see previous sidebar) once assembled a team of researchers that looked at the difficulty of removing the Secure Digital Music Initiative watermark— the product of the most ambitious and expensive watermarking project ever undertaken.

(Location 747)</p><p>Fundamentally, the only way to get computers to resist users’ attempts to see what’s going on inside them is to design programs with the facility to misreport their files and processes. And forcing such programs on users inevitably opens the door to spyware. (Location 772)</p><p>These computers came loaded with secret software that could operate the laptops’ cameras covertly (when the software ran, the cameras’ green activity lights stayed dark), as well as capture screengrabs and copy the files on the computers’ hard drives.

He found that HP had devoted a lot of resources to preventing the use of refilled cartridges, but almost none to other types of security. (Location 825)</p><p>Without a thorough understanding of our computers’ workings, and without independent verification of their security, it’s impossible to trust our machines. (Location 838)</p><p>In 2011, a security researcher named Trevor Eckhart discovered that some Android phones had shipped with a commercial rootkit called “Carrier IQ.” (Location 843)</p><p>When Eckhart published his findings, the carriers performed the classic deny-threaten-downplay tactics, (Location 847)</p><a href=#19-worse-than-nothing><h4 id=19-worse-than-nothing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.9 Worse Than Nothing</h4></a><p>Study after study shows that overseas downloading of U.S. TV shows drops off sharply when those shows are put on the air internationally. (Location 867)</p><p>Refusing to sell their viewers the content they wanted in the format they preferred drove those viewers to piracy. • Once the audience started pirating the content they wanted, they quickly turned to pirating other content, too. • Having become aware of and proficient in the ways of downloading, the audience developed a downloading habit that outlasted the end of the blackout. (Location 891)</p><p>If you’re a publisher, label, or studio, the answer is simple: don’t let companies sell your goods with digital locks on them.

(Location 1041)</p><p>Even famous and successful acts, who represent a major source of revenue for the labels, usually can’t renegotiate the deals they signed starting out. (Location 1057)</p><p>The reason the deal is nonnegotiable is that it is industry-wide. There are only three major record labels, and they all offer the same rotten terms to their new artists. (Location 1061)</p><p>If you sign with an indie label today, there’s every chance that you’ll be recorded, mixed, and mastered by the same engineers and producers, in the same studio, that you would have been working with if you’d gone with a major.
