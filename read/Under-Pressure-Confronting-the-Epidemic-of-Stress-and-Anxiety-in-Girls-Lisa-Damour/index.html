(Location 113)</p><p>Our daughters hit puberty earlier than our sons do, and the age of puberty for girls keeps dropping. (Location 130)</p><p>Reacting with alarm to normal difficulties can make them worse and even contribute to a girl’s unhealthy levels of stress and anxiety. (Location 157)</p><a href=#chapter-one-coming-to-terms-with-stress-and-anxiety><h3 id=chapter-one-coming-to-terms-with-stress-and-anxiety><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER ONE Coming to Terms with Stress and Anxiety</h3></a><p>stress and anxiety aren’t all bad. In fact, you can’t thrive without them. (Location 178)</p><p>both common sense and scientific research tell us that the stress of operating beyond our comfort zones helps us grow. (Location 188)</p><p>Pushing ourselves past familiar limits builds our capacities in the same way that runners prepare for marathons by gradually extending the distances at which they train. (Location 190)</p><p>people who are able to weather difficult life experiences, such as riding out a serious illness, often go on to demonstrate higher-than-average resilience when faced with new hardships. (Location 192)</p><p>When we let our own inner Chicken Little take over and panic in the face of manageable challenges, we set a bad example. When we accept that stress often leads to growth—and help our girls do the same—we create a self-fulfilling prophecy for ourselves and for our daughters. (Location 202)</p><p>Whether stress becomes unhealthy depends on two variables: the nature of the problem and the person upon whom the problem lands. (Location 210)</p><p>Psychologists consider stress to be unhealthy when it interferes with well-being in the short or long term. (Location 211)</p><p>When psychologists study stress and its impact on health, we sort it into three distinct domains, namely life events, daily hassles, and chronic stress. (Location 235)</p><p>change equals stress. The more change a life event requires, the more taxing it will be. (Location 239)</p><p>Appreciating that our own daily hassles really do compound stress can spur us to take steps to minimize them. (Location 247)</p><p>for difficulties that cannot be changed, research shows that practicing acceptance is the critical first step. (Location 267)</p><p>Taking a strategic approach—fixing what we can and finding a way to live with what remains—makes it possible to feel less helpless and more relaxed, even in the face of substantial adversity. (Location 295)</p><p>stress usually refers to the feeling of emotional or mental strain or tension, anxiety usually refers to the feeling of fear, dread, or panic. (Location 298)</p><p>We can’t always tease stress and anxiety apart, and most of the time we don’t need to. For practical purposes, we can treat the two concepts as nearly interchangeable (Location 302)</p><p>Anxiety is a gift, handed down by evolution, to keep humans safe. (Location 307)</p><p>people (and teenagers are, of course, first and foremost people) feel much more comfortable broaching touchy topics when they’re not cornered into doing so. (Location 331)</p><p>when a girl gets anxious we want her to take that emotion seriously and wonder, “Why is my alarm going off? And what’s the best way to get it to quiet down?” (Location 367)</p><p>Even when anxiety serves a useful purpose—perhaps helping us discover an outside door flung open by the wind—it’s a biological, emotional, mental, and physical workout. (Location 385)</p><p>This constant ringing of the anxiety bell can undermine sleep, concentration, and, of course, the ability to feel calm or happy. (Location 392)</p><p>we diagnose an anxiety disorder only when a person’s worries are entirely out of proportion to the perceived threat or if they hamstring daily functioning. (Location 398)</p><p>At some point in our lifetimes, nearly 30 percent of us will be hit by a wave of anxiety so intense that it includes some combination of nausea, dizziness, numbness, tingling, a feeling of detachment from reality, chills, sweating, and, as already noted, fear that one is losing control or dying. (Location 405)</p><p>we diagnose panic disorder only when recurrent, unexpected attacks sow the constant fear of having another attack or cause people to rearrange their lives. (Location 408)</p><p>Panic attacks happen, but we don’t want to give a single attack more power than it deserves. (Location 421)</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) takes a tailored and systematic approach to treating the four components of anxiety we’ve addressed. (Location 434)</p><p>I asked tentatively, “Is there any chance that you’re feeling sort of frustrated with her?” In truth, I suspected that Simone was far more than frustrated, but I’ve learned to tiptoe toward any feeling that is being kept at bay. Asking, “Are you enraged?” only shuts clients down, especially when they have built ramparts around their anger. (Location 470)</p><p>Not all anxiety can be chalked up to a hidden cause, but we should bear in mind that anxiety works to alert us to threats both from without and from within. (Location 482)</p><p>When therapy doesn’t provide sufficient relief, or work quickly enough, anxious feelings can also be managed with medical help. (Location 486)</p><p>The symptoms of anxiety are usually warded off so long as the medication is in use, which allows clients to capitalize on the anxiety cease-fire to explore hidden, difficult feelings in therapy or to learn relaxation techniques, thinking strategies, and routines that may give them the option of ultimately managing their distress without medication. (Location 500)</p><p>Mindfulness addresses anxiety by teaching its practitioners to carefully observe their emotions, ideas, and sensations, but not to get carried away by them. (Location 505)</p><p>Then, once the people we care for are in close touch with their own painful, upsetting, or frightening internal worlds, we step back to reassuringly point out that what they have discovered is only a thought or only a feeling—and that they have options for how they might respond to their ideas and emotions. (Location 510)</p><p>To help girls manage their jitters, we address the same four response systems that serve as a safeguard in healthy anxiety and misfire when anxiety is out of control: physical reactions, emotional responses, thought patterns, and behavioral impulses. (Location 528)</p><p>The brain is particularly interested in dispatches arriving from the respiratory system because, if a person is suffocating, the brain needs to tell the body to start freaking out. (Location 545)</p><p>Square breathing is easy to do, but it’s most effective if it’s a well-worn groove that a girl can slip into when she’s feeling afraid.” (Location 556)</p><p>You’ll want to validate her concerns while helping her see that they’re probably exaggerated.” (Location 563)</p><p>anxiety can get us to do things that provide immediate relief—such as seeking reassurance or compulsively checking on something we’re worried about—but these nervous habits don’t help in the long run because they only reinforce the idea that something’s really wrong. (Location 573)</p><a href=#chapter-two-girls-at-home><h3 id=chapter-two-girls-at-home><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER TWO Girls at Home</h3></a><p>full-blown phobias can develop when people routinely evade the things they fear. (Location 630)</p><p>When your girl wants you to stand between her and something she fears, resist acting on your gut instinct—the protective impulse to rescue her—and turn your attention toward helping her approach the source of her anxiety. (Location 659)</p><p>She’s letting you know how helpless she feels by making you feel every bit as helpless, too. There are many ways to share a feeling. At our best, we can put our emotions into words and express them to the caring, supportive people in our lives, knowing that they will respond with warmth and compassion. At our not-so-best, we become overwhelmed by our emotions and communicate them by inducing them in others. This is what happens when we feel angry and decide to pick a fight. (Location 673)</p><p>When a teenager becomes upset, her supercharged emotions can hijack the whole neurological system, unleashing a blinding glitter storm and turning your otherwise rational daughter into a sobbing puddle on your kitchen floor. (Location 702)</p><p>As parents we want to respond, but not react, to our daughters’ meltdowns. (Location 733)</p><p>Why doesn’t reassurance work, especially in response to irrational concerns? Because it doesn’t take the problem, however silly it may seem, seriously and thus strikes girls as dismissive. If we want to get rid of a worry for good, we must earnestly engage it. (Location 747)</p><p>Modeling the ability to tolerate a bad situation helps our daughters to do the same. (Location 753)</p><p>Taking time to strategize seriously with girls, even about concerns that we view as overblown, helps them to feel calmer and more in control. (Location 754)</p><p>the stuff of life can be divided into three categories: things we like, things we can handle, and things that constitute a crisis. Anyone who spends time with young people knows that when children and teenagers become upset, they can forget about that middle category. (Location 762)</p><p>To me, asking a girl how she wants to handle something feels like a vote of confidence. It gives her some say in her misery and moves her out of the position of simply hoping the problem will go away. (Location 794)</p><p>managing intractable stress: first she must find a way to accept the situation, then she must find a happy distraction. (Location 797)</p><p>acknowledging that a situation stinks and will need to be handled sends a powerful, stress-reducing message: “I’m truly sorry about what you are facing. The good news is that this is not a crisis and that I’m here to help you manage it.” (Location 808)</p><p>empathize with how wretched it must be to feel that way. (Location 814)</p><p>If you are feeling overwhelmed by stress or if you often experience high levels of anxiety, make sure that you are getting the support you deserve, (Location 836)</p><p>using the defense of rationalization to make the best of a bad situation. (Location 849)</p><p>so long as we use a variety of defenses and avoid the ones that warp the truth or damage relationships, these mental shields make it possible for us to withstand the psychological slings and arrows of everyday life. (Location 853)</p><p>Psychologists have long understood that teenagers sometimes deal with painful feelings by handing their unwanted emotions off to their parents. (Location 895)</p><p>For parenting, cellphones aren’t altogether different. Like CT scans, they can provide a ton of information that stands to be both anxiety-provoking and difficult to interpret. (Location 957)</p><p>irreverence and boundary-pushing are actually signs of normal and healthy development in teenagers (Location 963)</p><p>decades of being a practicing clinician have convinced me that the most powerful force for good in a young person’s life is having a caring, working relationship with at least one loving adult. (Location 982)</p><p>supervising our daughter’s digital activity cannot keep her safe if we don’t also have a clear and direct line of communication with her. (Location 985)</p><p>it’s best to try to set our family’s baseline activity levels at about 75 percent of what we can actually accomplish. (Location 1020)</p><p>often, we make the most of time just by having it. Deliberately underscheduling my family—always against my own instincts—continues to prove itself a reliable strategy for reducing the strain in our lives, and on many days increasing the joy. (Location 1032)</p><p>Lund and Dearing found that prosperity, in and of itself, posed no risk to healthy psychological development. The affluence of a family’s neighborhood, however, did matter, and it mattered a lot. (Location 1049)</p><p>under stress, girls collapse in on themselves and boys act out. (Location 1053)</p><p>it is sometimes true that we can ease the stress that we, and our daughters, feel by deciding to know, do, and spend less. (Location 1080)</p><a href=#chapter-three-girls-among-girls><h3 id=chapter-three-girls-among-girls><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER THREE Girls Among Girls</h3></a><p>Long-established research tells us that newborns come preprogrammed with dispositions and that most babies can be assigned to one of three categories: easy children, who are generally cheerful and adapt quickly to novelty; difficult children, who have irregular routines, dislike change, and can be pretty cranky; and slow-to-warm-up children who are pretty low-key and need a long time to adjust to new experiences. (Location 1123)</p><p>Though our culture rewards extroverts who jump into new situations with both feet, there’s a lot to be said for those who watch and wait before deciding how to move forward. (Location 1168)</p><p>over time, it probably won’t take so long for her cautious first reaction to give way to a second reaction once her visceral response dies down. (Location 1176)</p><p>the happiest girls are those with one or two solid friendships. Having a couple of reliable buddies reduces stress by lending predictability to girls’ social lives. (Location 1188)</p><p>Studies find that girls are more empathic than boys, a difference that is explained by how we socialize our daughters and sons, not by some innate biological factor. Girls, more than boys, are raised on a steady diet of encouragement to “think about how the other person would feel,” (Location 1206)</p><p>Girls who are good at dealing with social friction spend more time enjoying their friends and less time ruminating about the latest social kerfuffle. (Location 1214)</p><p>our daughters look to us for cues about how troubled they should be when things go badly, so in order to be most helpful, we need to accept that it’s normal for girls to have difficulty getting along. (Location 1215)</p><p>Girls, as a group, are bad at dealing with conflict because people, as a group, are bad at dealing with it. (Location 1219)</p><p>Once we accept that putting more than one conscious person in the same room guarantees that, eventually, there will be friction, we can turn our energy toward understanding the ins and outs of interpersonal discord. (Location 1223)</p><p>The three forms of unhealthy conflict are instantly recognizable: acting as a bulldozer, acting as a doormat, or acting as a doormat with spikes. A bulldozer deals with disagreements by running people over, while doormats allow themselves to be run over. The doormat with spikes employs passive-aggressive tactics, such as using guilt as a weapon, playing the part of the victim, or involving third parties in what should be a one-on-one disagreement. (Location 1226)</p><p>For healthy conflict, the guiding metaphor is a pillar. It stands up for itself without stepping on anyone else. (Location 1231)</p><p>if we can recognize and observe our first reaction—to be a bulldozer, doormat, or doormat with spikes—without allowing ourselves to act on it, we can usually find our way to reflecting on how we might become a pillar as our second reaction. (Location 1233)</p><p>it is basically impossible to be a pillar online because pillar communications rely heavily on tone. (Location 1290)</p><p>aikido, if someone is coming at you, the first thing you do is step out of that person’s path. This pulls you out of harm’s way, and it can leave your opponent off balance.” (Location 1313)</p><p>how competent adult women often handle interpersonal conflicts. We pick our battles. We decide when, and with whom, a confrontation is worthwhile. (Location 1334)</p><p>confrontation, even when done well, is psychologically taxing. (Location 1336)</p><p>Experts note that adolescents aren’t enthralled by technology—they’re enthralled by the peers on the other end of the technology they happen to be using.

(Location 2803)</p><p>Let’s start with the assumption that there’s a logic to how our daughters speak, even when their style rubs us the wrong way. Girls are excellent at reflecting on how they express themselves. We should not hesitate to ask them what’s behind their language choices and, if necessary, help them consider other options at their disposal.

(Location 2858)</p><p>Perhaps the most effective tool in a girl’s verbal Swiss Army knife is her deft use of intonation, which, as we know, sits at the heart of communication. (Location 2861)</p><p>“I’m excited about the movie but can’t make the sleepover”—have your daughter play with the many tones that could give it a huge range of meanings. The exact same words can be said brusquely, sheepishly, caustically, or—what we’re shooting for here—with a gentle confidence that communicates her lack of guilt about her sleepover regrets, and genuine delight in getting to see the movie with her friends. (Location 2868)</p><p>Having negative thoughts and feelings is not inherently problematic, since thinking, feeling, and doing operate independently of one another. We can’t easily control—and rarely need to control—what we think and feel. We must only regulate how we actually conduct ourselves.

To be completely “honest,” she must make no attempt to hide her irritation and suffer the consequences. Or, the girl must feel ashamed of her irritation and fretfully search for a way to purge her heart (and mind and behavior) of any unpleasantness. (Location 2904)</p><p>As parents, we sometimes forget that our girls have, and should have, front and back stages.
