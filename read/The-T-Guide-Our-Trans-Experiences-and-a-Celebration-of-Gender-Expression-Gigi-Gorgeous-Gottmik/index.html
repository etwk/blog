We all have lots of different sexual characteristics, many of which change during our lifetimes. (Location 142)</p><p>Gender’s who I am. Sexuality is who I love. (Location 150)</p><p>And it’s a journey. Every stage of my transition has come with a new level of acceptance. (Location 153)</p><p>I have to constantly check in with myself to make sure I’m making choices because I want to, and not because of the pressure I’m getting from society. (Location 158)</p><p>and the spectrum of gender and sexuality is nuanced. (Location 163)</p><p>is a great example of someone who doesn’t subscribe to society’s ideas about gender. One day she’ll wake up and be like, “I’m a girl today,” and another day, she’ll wake up and be somewhere on the spectrum between girl and boy. She doesn’t feel the need to transition. She’s just very cool with who she is, and how people perceive her doesn’t affect her mentally in any way. (Location 171)</p><p>I went to see a doctor in Orange County to have a vein removed from my forehead. In order for him to see it more clearly, I had to sit upside down in a medical chair so it would protrude.

For a long time, I didn’t even know why I was unhappy. Was it because I thought I might be trans and I didn’t know how to deal with it? Or was it because I was just depressed? The first step was figuring out the answers to those questions. (Location 240)</p><p>or if you’re just not sure about what you want to say yet, then try to keep yourself happy until you have your answers. I know that might sound trite, but it can be useful. (Location 246)</p><p>I think one of the reasons I didn’t transition for so long was because I didn’t see a lot of examples of men I wanted to look like. Every trans guy I saw in the media was hyper-masculine and muscle-obsessed. (Location 264)</p><p>But at the end of the day, making sure you’re supporting your child and making sure they’re happy is the most important thing.

(Location 346)</p><a href=#advice-for-parents><h4 id=advice-for-parents><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Advice for Parents</h4></a><p>Parents, if your kid comes out to you, the only correct response is, “I love you.” Even if you’re freaking out inside, still say, “I love you.” And after that, just listen to what your kid is telling you. (Location 398)</p><p>I was so over them. I hated their reaction, and I was ready to cut them off. Then you invited them to LA, Gigi, and after that trip, they realized it wasn’t a phase, and they got into acceptance. (Location 407)</p><p>She was sad because she thought my life was going to be harder, and she worried that I wouldn’t be successful. So, become successful, people! And that doesn’t necessarily mean getting money or fame. It just means thriving. (Location 434)</p><p>I feel one popular mistake parents make is thinking that they’ve failed in some way, and wondering what they’re going to tell their friends. This type of selfishness is so not useful. If your kid comes out to you, don’t think about yourself. Think about your kid. (Location 449)</p><p>Get into it or get lost, parents!

And even though it feels better to be accepted by the people you love, acceptance isn’t really the goal. The goal is for you to feel free.

Looking back, I should have found an experienced counselor to talk to during the beginning of the process and onward— someone I could share the worries and fears with that I didn’t feel comfortable talking to others about.

It wasn’t just about changing the way I presented externally; it was an internal process of self-acceptance, self-declaration, and decolonization.

(Location 790)</p><a href=#category-is-hormones-aka-mones><h4 id=category-is-hormones-aka-mones><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Category is: Hormones (aka ’Mones)</h4></a><p>Testosterone lowers your voice, and estrogen doesn’t affect your voice at all. (Location 807)</p><p>I wasn’t fully aware of how much I had needed hormones until I started taking them. I didn’t know that feeling so much better in my body was even an option. I loved the physical effects, and I loved the emotional effects, too. As a kid, I’d had such a problem with empathy. I never cried. I wasn’t very good at putting myself in somebody else’s shoes. Well, after about a month on hormones, I had all kinds of feelings I didn’t even know I could have. It was strange at first, and also really interesting. It allowed me to start seeing myself in a new way. Eventually, after a few more months, my emotions evened out, and I just got more used to them. (Location 822)</p><p>That’s what’s great about hormones— you can always slow the process down a bit. Just make sure you do your research because there are some irreversible side effects. (Location 831)</p><p>Testosterone basically puts you through male puberty and pretty much everything changes: your voice, your orgasms, your body, where your fat distributes. (Location 841)</p><p>You can change the features of your face with surgery and other procedures, but trans girls can’t change their voice in a major way. The register is just lower than a cis woman’s. (Location 876)</p><p>And you can get surgery on your vocal cords, but it’s risky. (Location 883)</p><p>bottom growth on testosterone. Basically, your clitoris grows up to 3 inches in size.

Trans guys often get a subcutaneous mastectomy. Trans girls are generally left with a smaller, less visible scar, while the scar after top surgery for guys (depending on the type of surgery) is generally larger. (Location 933)</p><p>The list of procedures under the FFS umbrella might include forehead contouring, eye and eyelid modification, cheek augmentation, nose reshaping, lip lift, jaw angle reduction, chin width reduction, tracheal shave, lowering the hairline, and hair transplantation. (Location 938)</p><p>One rule after top surgery for some trans guys is that you’re not allowed to lift your arms up over your head for six months, (Location 966)</p><p>it turns out there are tons of differences between cisgender men and cisgender women when it comes to the face. Men tend to have a ridge above their eyes called a “caveman brow,” for example, whereas on women, that area is generally flat. (Location 981)</p><p>And I would say that if you’re uncomfortable with one of your features, don’t be afraid to change it, and don’t be afraid to trust your intuition. I invented a lot of the things that I did, just because it seemed intuitive to me.

It’s still in process, which is kind of scary, especially for trans guys. There are two options, metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, (Location 1027)</p><p>Metoidioplasty: a gender-affirming, lower body surgery that creates a penis by cutting ligaments around the erectile tissue (clitoris) to release it from the pubis and give the shaft more length! (Location 1031)</p><p>The female orgasm is more of an all-body sensation, and the orgasm on testosterone is much more centralized, and weirdly addictive. (Location 1048)</p><p>I also wonder how society will change in the future. Are we always going to assign gender by sex? I hope not. (Location 1070)</p><p>Coming to terms with how I want to have sex was really the turning point for me in terms of bottom surgery.
