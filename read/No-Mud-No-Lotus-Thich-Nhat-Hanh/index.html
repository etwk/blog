But suffering is a kind of mud to help the lotus flower of happiness grow. There can be no lotus flower without the mud.” —THICH NHAT HANH (Location 15)</p><a href=#1-the-art-of-transforming-suffering><h3 id=1-the-art-of-transforming-suffering><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1 The Art of Transforming Suffering</h3></a><p>Being able to enjoy happiness doesn’t require that we have zero suffering. (Location 45)</p><p>there is no realm where there’s only happiness and there’s no suffering. (Location 48)</p><p>Knowing how to suffer well is essential to realizing true happiness. (Location 56)</p><p>If there’s no right, then there’s no left. Where there is no suffering, there can be no happiness either, and vice versa. (Location 62)</p><p>Suffering isn’t some kind of external, objective source of oppression and pain. There might be things that cause you to suffer, such as loud music or bright lights, which may bring other people joy. (Location 67)</p><p>Some people think that in order to be happy they must avoid all suffering, and so they are constantly vigilant, constantly worrying. They end up sacrificing all their spontaneity, freedom, and joy. (Location 71)</p><p>If you can recognize and accept your pain without running away from it, you will discover that although pain is there, joy can also be there at the same time. (Location 72)</p><p>The way to suffer well and be happy is to stay in touch with what is actually going on; in doing so, you will gain liberating insights into the true nature of suffering and of joy. (Location 75)</p><p>they are always changing. The flower, when it wilts, becomes the compost. The compost can help grow a flower again. (Location 78)</p><p>It’s easy enough to notice mud all over you at times. The hardest thing to practice is not allowing yourself to be overwhelmed by despair. (Location 90)</p><p>If you know how to make good use of the mud, you can grow beautiful lotuses. If you know how to make good use of suffering, you can produce happiness. (Location 100)</p><p>The Buddha’s Four Noble Truths are: there is suffering; there is a course of action that generates suffering; suffering ceases (i.e., there is happiness); and there is a course of action leading to the cessation of suffering (the arising of happiness). (Location 110)</p><p>there is the suffering of the mind, including anxiety, jealousy, despair, fear, and anger. (Location 118)</p><p>While we can’t avoid all the suffering in life, we can suffer much less by not watering the seeds of suffering inside us. (Location 119)</p><p>Suffering can be either physical or mental or both, but every kind of suffering manifests somewhere in the body and creates tension and stress. (Location 121)</p><p>Nonhuman animals instinctively know that stopping is the best way to get healed. (Location 127)</p><p>We don’t know how to rest anymore. We don’t allow the body to rest, to release the tension, and heal. (Location 129)</p><p>we can sometimes use them in smaller quantities and to much greater effect when we know how to let our body and mind truly rest. (Location 132)</p><p>The main affliction of our modern civilization is that we don’t know how to handle the suffering inside us and we try to cover it up with all kinds of consumption. (Location 134)</p><p>Mindfulness is the capacity to dwell in the present moment, to know what’s happening in the here and now. (Location 141)</p><p>Mindfulness is always mindfulness of something. It’s the energy that helps us be aware of what is happening right now and right here, in our body, in our feelings, in our perceptions, and around us. (Location 147)</p><p>By being aware of your in-breath and out-breath you generate the energy of mindfulness, so you can continue to cradle the suffering. (Location 150)</p><p>With mindfulness we are no longer afraid of pain. We can even go further and make good use of suffering to generate the energy of understanding and compassion that heals us and we can help others to heal and be happy as well. (Location 152)</p><p>The way we start producing the medicine of mindfulness is by stopping and taking a conscious breath, giving our complete attention to our in-breath and our out-breath. (Location 154)</p><p>We are truly alive only when the mind is with the body. The great news is that oneness of body and mind can be realized just by one in-breath. (Location 156)</p><p>Recognizing the tension, the pain, the stress in our body, we can bathe it in our mindful awareness, and that is the beginning of healing. (Location 158)</p><p>If we take care of the suffering inside us, we have more clarity, energy, and strength to help address the suffering violence, poverty, and inequity of our loved ones as well as the suffering in our community and the world. (Location 159)</p><a href=#2-saying-hello><h3 id=2-saying-hello><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2 Saying Hello</h3></a><p>Our thinking, perceiving, and worrying take away all the space inside us, and keep us from being in touch with what’s happening moment to moment. (Location 168)</p><p>Love needs to be nurtured and fed to survive; and our suffering also survives because we enable and feed it. (Location 171)</p><p>If we try to use consumption to ignore or distract ourselves from our suffering, we end up making the suffering worse. (Location 174)</p><p>We don’t feel very well inside, so in order to forget, we go and look for something to eat even if we’re not hungry at all. We eat in an attempt to feel better, but we end up becoming addicted to eating, because we are trying to cover up the suffering inside, and the real problem is left unaddressed. (Location 178)</p><p>Electronic distractions not only fail to help heal the underlying suffering, they may contain stories or images that feed our craving, jealousy, anger, or despair. Instead of making us feel better, they numb us only briefly, then make us feel worse. (Location 181)</p><p>When suffering arises, the first thing to do is to stop, follow our breathing, and acknowledge it. (Location 186)</p><p>Breathing in, I know suffering is there.
Breathing out, I say hello to my suffering. (Location 188)</p><p>In just two or three breaths taken with your full attention, you may notice that regret and sorrow about the past have paused, as well as uncertainty, fear, and worries about the future. (Location 192)</p><p>When we breathe in and focus our attention on our in-breath, we reunite body and mind. We become aware of what is going on in the present moment, in our body, in our perceptions, and around us. (Location 201)</p><p>most of our thinking is unproductive. When we think, it may be easy for us to be lost in our thinking. But when we use our breath to bring our mind home to the body, we can stop the thinking. (Location 203)</p><p>If you continue to breathe in and out mindfully, you maintain that state of presence and freedom. Your mind will be clearer and you will make better decisions. (Location 206)</p><p>When you practice mindfulness of breathing, you know right away that you are alive, and that to be alive is a wonder. (Location 209)</p><p>If you can be aware that you have a living body, and notice when there’s tension in your body, that’s already an important insight. (Location 210)</p><p>You don’t need to struggle to control your breathing. In fact, breathing in can become a real pleasure. You just allow yourself to breathe in naturally while focusing your attention on your in-breath. (Location 213)</p><p>The sunshine doen’t interfere with the flower. The sunshine just embraces and subtly permeates the flower. Embraced by the energy of the sunshine, the flower begins to bloom. (Location 215)</p><p>But if we don’t have the time and the willingness to take care of ourselves, how can we offer any genuine care to the people we love? (Location 224)</p><p>Suffering is one energy. Mindfulness is another energy that we can call on to come and embrace the suffering. (Location 227)</p><p>With mindful breathing, you can recognize the presence of a painful feeling, just like an older sibling greets a younger sibling. (Location 229)</p><p>The function of mindfulness is, first, to recognize the suffering and then to take care of the suffering. (Location 234)</p><p>A mother taking care of a crying baby naturally will take the child into her arms without suppressing, judging it, or ignoring the crying. Mindfulness is like that mother, recognizing and embracing suffering without judgment. (Location 236)</p><p>If we can recognize and cradle the suffering while we breathe mindfully, there is relief already. (Location 241)</p><p>Once you have offered your acknowledgment and care to this suffering, it naturally will become less impenetrable and more workable; and then you have the chance to look into it deeply, with kindness (but still always with a solid ground of mindful breathing to support you), and find out why it has come to you. (Location 246)</p><p>It is trying to get your attention, to tell you something, and now you can take the opportunity to listen. You can ask someone to look with you— a teacher, a friend, a psychotherapist. (Location 248)</p><p>you can explore what kind of roots it has, and what nutriments and habits of consumption have been feeding your sorrow. (Location 249)</p><p>A bell of mindfulness, whether it is an actual bell or some other sound, is a wonderful reminder to come back to ourselves, to come back to life here in the present moment. (Location 254)</p><p>Every one of us has Buddha nature— the capacity for compassionate, clear, understanding nature— within us. (Location 256)</p><p>In my tradition, every time we hear the bell, we pause. We stop moving, talking, and thinking, and we listen to the voice of the heart. (Location 258)</p><p>we say we “invite the bell” to sound, because the bell is a friend, an enlightened friend that helps us wake up and guides us home to ourselves. Gentleness and nonviolence are characteristics of the sound of the bell. (Location 260)</p><p>If you want to experience what the end of suffering will feel like, it is in the here and the now with this breath. If you want nirvana, it’s right here. (Location 263)</p><a href=#3-looking-deeply><h3 id=3-looking-deeply><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3 Looking Deeply</h3></a><p>After we’ve cradled and embraced our suffering for some time, we can look deeply into it and begin to understand what has caused it and what has been feeding it. (Location 271)</p><p>Understanding the nature of the situation makes it much easier to transform it. (Location 272)</p><p>To connect with others, however, we first have to be willing to look deeply into ourselves. (Location 279)</p><p>if you have suffering in you and you don’t know where it comes from, looking deeply you may see that this is the suffering of your ancestors, handed down from one generation to another, because no one knew how to recognize, embrace, and heal it. (Location 295)</p><p>we can heal not only our own suffering and that of our ancestors, but we can also avoid transmitting this suffering to our loved ones, to our children, and their children. (Location 304)</p><p>if you take the time to still the activities of body and mind and look deeply, you may see that you are dying right this very moment. (Location 311)</p><p>You are dying now. You have been dying all the time. It’s actually very pleasant to die, which is also to live. (Location 313)</p><p>There is no birth and death; everything dies and renews itself all the time. When you get that kind of insight, you no longer tire yourself out with anxiety and aversion. (Location 322)</p><p>We believe that we need to obtain a certain diploma or career in order to be safe and be a success. There are people who are victims of this kind of success. They get the things they worked so hard to achieve, and then they find themselves trapped in ways they hadn’t anticipated. (Location 326)</p><p>Many of us slog through life without conscious awareness or intention. We set ourselves a course and we barrel ahead, without stopping to ask whether this path is fulfilling our most important goals. (Location 331)</p><p>If we haven’t taken the time to stop, come home to ourselves, and look deeply, we may not know what brings us our deepest happiness. (Location 346)</p><p>We need to stop and ask, “Can I realize my deepest aspiration if I pursue this path?” “What is really preventing me from taking the path I most deeply desire?” (Location 348)</p><p>looking more deeply, we can see the true sources of our own suffering, and we also can see that the person who we think is out to get us is a victim of his or her own suffering. (Location 354)</p><p>Understanding our own hurt allows us to see and understand the suffering of others. Looking without judgment, we can understand, and compassion is born. (Location 355)</p><p>When there is no more blame or criticism in your eyes, when you are able to look at others with compassion, you see things very differently. You speak differently. The other person can sense you are truly seeing her and understanding her, and that already eases her pain significantly. (Location 362)</p><p>when compassion is born in your heart, you naturally want to reach out, to help others suffer less. (Location 367)</p><p>If you haven’t suffered hunger, you can’t appreciate having something to eat. If you haven’t gone through a war, you don’t know the value of peace. That is why we should not try to run away from one unpleasant thing after another. (Location 371)</p><p>Holding our suffering, looking deeply into it, and transforming it into compassion, we find a way to happiness. (Location 373)</p><p>They aren’t communicating with themselves, and we aren’t communicating with ourselves, so is it any wonder we have difficulty communicating with each other? (Location 380)</p><p>The situation doesn’t call for blame or punishment; it calls for understanding and compassion. (Location 381)</p><p>The most effective way to show compassion to another is to listen, rather than talk. (Location 386)</p><p>In the practice of compassionate listening, you listen with only one purpose, which is to give the other person the chance to speak out and to suffer less. (Location 387)</p><p>If I jump in with my perspective on things or correct her, it will become a debate, not a practice of deep listening. Another time, there may be a chance for me to offer her a little information so that she can correct her wrong perception. But not now.” That kind of mindfulness helps you to keep your compassion alive and protects you from having the seed of anger in you touched off. (Location 393)</p><p>“It’s not my intention to make you suffer. I didn’t understand your suffering. I’m sorry. Please help me by telling me about your struggles and your difficulties. I need help in understanding you.” (Location 398)</p><p>“I know you have suffered a lot during the past many years. I was not able to help you to suffer less. Instead, I have made the situation worse. I have reacted with anger and stubbornness, and instead of helping you, I have made you suffer more. I am very sorry.” (Location 400)</p><p>Many of us are no longer able to use that kind of language with the other person because we have suffered so much. But when we consciously practice deep listening and loving speech, so much healing and happiness is possible. (Location 401)</p><p>Take it as a reminder to breathe in and out three times slowly, paying attention to your breath. Try to smile. (Location 408)</p><p>Play the role of a bell of mindfulness. Your squeezing the hand is like a bell, lovingly calling your friend to come back to himself.

If you aren’t solid, you won’t be able to accomplish much. (Location 1156)</p><p>Each morning, you rededicate yourself to your path in order not to go astray. Before going to sleep at night, take a few minutes to review the day. “Did I live in the direction of my ideals today?” If you see that you took two or three steps in that direction, that is good enough. If you didn’t, say to yourself, “I’ll do better tomorrow.” Don’t compare yourself with others. Just look to yourself to see whether you are going in the direction you cherish.
