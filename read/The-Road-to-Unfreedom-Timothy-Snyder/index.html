(Location 44)</p><p>Postwar, published in 2005. (Location 48)</p><p>the Nazi-Soviet alliance that began the Second World War in Europe. (Location 62)</p><p>In April 1940, the Soviet secret police murdered 21,892 Polish prisoners of war, most of them educated reserve officers. (Location 63)</p><p>Since the end of the Soviet Union, the new Russian Federation had been struggling to address the legacy of Stalinist terror. (Location 68)</p><p>A new Polish mother asked me what I thought. I said that this was all very unlikely. (Location 85)</p><p>In Poland, the Smolensk catastrophe united society for a day, and then polarized it for years. (Location 94)</p><p>In 2013, Russia turned against the European Union, condemning it as decadent and hostile. Its success might encourage Russians to think that former empires could become prosperous democracies, and so its existence was suddenly at risk. (Location 100)</p><p>a new unfreedom to suit a new time. (Location 108)</p><p>The machines that were meant to create time were consuming it instead. As we lost our ability to concentrate and recall, everything seemed new. (Location 116)</p><p>In the American capitalist version of this story, nature brought the market, which brought democracy, which brought happiness. (Location 123)</p><p>Americans and Europeans kept telling themselves their tales of inevitability for a quarter century after the end of communism, and so raised a millennial generation without history. (Location 129)</p><p>The financial crisis of 2008 and the deregulation of campaign contributions in the United States in 2010 magnified the influence of the wealthy and reduced that of voters. (Location 133)</p><p>The collapse of the politics of inevitability ushers in another experience of time: the politics of eternity. (Location 137)</p><p>In power, eternity politicians manufacture crisis and manipulate the resultant emotion. (Location 142)</p><p>Inevitability and eternity translate facts into narratives. (Location 150)</p><p>Eternity politicians suppress facts in order to dismiss the reality that people are freer and richer in other countries, and the idea that reforms could be formulated on the basis of knowledge. (Location 156)</p><p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was a reality test for the European Union and the United States. (Location 162)</p><p>What has already happened in Russia is what might happen in America and Europe: the stabilization of massive inequality, the displacement of policy by propaganda, the shift from the politics of inevitability to the politics of eternity. (Location 172)</p><p>Americans tend to react to surprise in two ways: either by imagining that the unexpected event is not really happening, or by claiming that it is totally new and hence not amenable to historical understanding. (Location 176)</p><p>in the 2010s influence flowed from east to west, as the offshore exception became the rule, as Russian political fiction penetrated beyond Russia. (Location 185)</p><p>Eternity politicians first spread fake news themselves, then claim that all news is fake, and finally that only their spectacles are real. (Location 192)</p><p>The advisor of the first pro-Russian American presidential candidate had been the advisor of the last pro-Russian Ukrainian president. (Location 197)</p><p>By suggesting that political foundations cannot really change, the politics of inevitability spread uncertainty as to what those foundations really are. (Location 211)</p><p>History is and must be political thought, in the sense that it opens an aperture between inevitability and eternity, preventing us from drifting from the one to the other, helping us see the moment when we might make a difference. (Location 214)</p><p>If institutions are to flourish, they need virtues; if virtues are to be cultivated, they need institutions. (Location 222)</p><a href=#chapter-one-individualism-or-totalitarianism-2011><h3 id=chapter-one-individualism-or-totalitarianism-2011><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER ONE INDIVIDUALISM OR TOTALITARIANISM (2011)</h3></a><p>To accept this is to deny individual responsibility for seeing history and making change. (Location 234)</p><p>An oligarch spinning a tale of an innocent past, perhaps with the help of fascist ideas, offers fake protection to people with real pain. Faith that technology serves freedom opens the way to his spectacle. As distraction replaces concentration, the future dissolves in the frustrations of the present, and eternity becomes daily life. (Location 238)</p><p>Russia reached the politics of eternity first, and Russian leaders protected themselves and their wealth by exporting it. (Location 242)</p><p>History always continues, and alternatives always present themselves. (Location 252)</p><p>If we accept eternity, we sacrifice individuality, and will no longer see possibility. (Location 258)</p><p>In the 2010s, Putin relied upon Ilyin’s authority to explain why Russia had to undermine the European Union and invade Ukraine. (Location 275)</p><p>His propaganda master Vladislav Surkov adapted Ilyin’s ideas to the world of modern media. Surkov orchestrated Putin’s rise to power and oversaw the consolidation of media that ensured Putin’s seemingly eternal rule. (Location 278)</p><p>In early 2014, members of Russia’s ruling party and all of Russia’s civil servants received a collection of Ilyin’s political publications from the Kremlin. (Location 283)</p><p>To think historically is to accept that the unfamiliar might be significant, and to work to make the unfamiliar the familiar. (Location 293)</p><p>Like the period from the late 1980s to the early 2010s, so the period from the late 1880s to the early 1910s was one of globalization. (Location 294)</p><p>According to Ilyin, communism had been inflicted upon innocent Russia by the decadent West. One day Russia would liberate itself and others with the help of Christian fascism. (Location 315)</p><p>Having removed God from the scene, Ilyin himself could issue judgments about what is and what ought to be. (Location 339)</p><p>Like all immorality, eternity politics begins by making an exception for itself. (Location 348)</p><p>Like fascists and other authoritarians of his day, Ilyin insisted that his nation was a creature, “an organism of nature and the soul,” an animal in Eden without original sin. (Location 361)</p><p>In such a scheme it was easy for Ilyin, who knew little of actual Russian history, to grasp centuries in simple phrases. (Location 375)</p><p>According to Ilyin, every single battle ever fought by Russians was defensive. Russia was always the victim of a “continental blockade” by Europe. (Location 377)</p><p>Like other fascists, such as Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf, he turned Christian ideas of sacrifice and redemption towards new purposes. (Location 387)</p><p>The men who redeemed God’s flawed world had to ignore what God said about love. (Location 394)</p><p>Because the world was sinful and God was absent, his champion must emerge from some uncorrupted realm beyond history. “Power,” Ilyin imagined, “comes all by itself to the strong man.” (Location 401)</p><p>Fascism begins not with an assessment of what is within, but from a rejection of what is without. (Location 410)</p><p>“Everything begins in mystique and ends in politics,” as the poet Charles Péguy reminds us. (Location 421)</p><p>Destruction is always easier than creation. (Location 424)</p><p>Legal institutions that permit the succession of power allow citizens to envision a future where leaders change but states remain. Fascism, however, is about a sacred and eternal connection between the redeemer and his people. (Location 426)</p><p>Russia should be a zero-party state, redeemed only by a man. Parties should exist, according to Ilyin, only to help ritualize elections. (Location 433)</p><p>Rather than governing, the leader produces crisis and spectacle. (Location 449)</p><p>Ilyin used the word “law,” but he did not endorse the rule of law. By “law” he meant the relationship between the caprice of the redeemer and the obedience of everyone else. (Location 451)</p><p>Unified by their redeemer, their sins washed away in the blood of others, Russians would welcome God back to his creation. (Location 460)</p><p>Ilyin had no earthly idea, in other words, of how a Russian state could endure. (Location 466)</p><p>The very dread of what comes next generates a sense of threat that can be projected upon others as foreign policy. Totalitarianism is its own true enemy, and that is the secret it keeps from itself by attacking others. (Location 467)</p><p>remade the state to preserve their own gains. Having achieved this, Russian leaders had to define politics as being rather than doing. (Location 471)</p><p>Although Ilyin opposed Soviet power, the shape of his argument was eerily similar to that of the Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism in which all Soviet citizens were educated. (Location 475)</p><p>Ilyin and the Marxism he opposed shared a philosophical origin and language: that of Hegelianism. (Location 478)</p><p>Ilyin was a Right Hegelian. (Location 491)</p><p>When Ilyin was arrested by the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka, Lenin intervened on his behalf in order to express his admiration of Ilyin’s philosophy. (Location 503)</p><p>“The Bolsheviks would have no fundamental problem accepting Ivan Ilyin’s book. They consider themselves the bearers of absolute good and oppose those whom they regard as evil with force.” (Location 509)</p><p>The aftermath of the Second World War was the beginning of the end of the Soviet politics of inevitability, and thus the opening gesture towards a Russian politics of eternity. (Location 533)</p><p>The last decades of Soviet communism prepared Soviet citizens for Ilyin’s view of the world. (Location 541)</p><p>American conventional wisdom contributed to the disaster by suggesting that markets would create institutions, rather than stressing that institutions were needed for markets. (Location 543)</p><p>Ilyin’s ideas sanctified radical inequality at home, changed the subject of politics from reform to innocence, while defining the West as a permanent source of a spiritual threat. (Location 548)</p><p>No Russian state could be built on Ilyin’s concepts. But they did help robbers to present themselves as redeemers. (Location 550)</p><p>The politics of eternity cannot make Putin or any other man immortal. But it can make other ideas unthinkable. (Location 554)</p><p>The only thing that stands between inevitability and eternity is history, as considered and lived by individuals. (Location 557)</p><a href=#chapter-two-succession-or-failure-2012><h3 id=chapter-two-succession-or-failure-2012><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER TWO SUCCESSION OR FAILURE (2012)</h3></a><p>In discrediting democratic elections in 2011 and 2012, Vladimir Putin took on the mantle of the heroic redeemer and placed his country on the horns of Ilyin’s dilemma. (Location 571)</p><p>Leaders must think beyond themselves and their clans, to imagine how other people might succeed them in the future. (Location 579)</p><p>The mechanism that ensures that a state outlasts a leader is called the principle of succession. (Location 581)</p><p>The meaning of each election is the promise of the next one. Since each citizen is fallible, democracy transforms cumulative mistakes into a collective belief in the future. (Location 582)</p><p>The Bolsheviks were not concerned about succession because they believed that they were beginning a global revolution, not creating a state. (Location 585)</p><p>The party claimed legitimacy not from legal principle or continuity with the past, but from the glory of the revolution and bright promise of the future. (Location 589)</p><p>Marxism-Leninism was a politics of inevitability: the course of events was known in advance, socialism would displace capitalism, and party leaders knew the details and made the plans. (Location 591)</p><p>After Lenin’s death in 1924, it took Stalin about six years to defeat his rivals, several of whom were killed. (Location 597)</p><p>Rather than of a victory of communism to come, Brezhnev spoke in the 1970s of “really existing socialism.” Once Soviet citizens expected no improvements from the future, nostalgia had to fill the vacuum left by utopia. Brezhnev replaced the promise of future perfection with a cult of Stalin and his leadership in the Second World War. (Location 612)</p><p>The myth of the October Revolution promised everything; the myth of the Great Fatherland War promised nothing. (Location 617)</p><p>In the 1960s, some Czechoslovak communists believed that communism could be renewed. When the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to overthrow reform communists in 1968, (Location 623)</p><p>Gorbachev believed that communism could be reformed and a better future promised. His main opponent was the party itself, (Location 629)</p><p>Polish communists, facing economic crisis and political opposition, took him at his word, scheduled partially free elections in 1989, and lost. (Location 631)</p><p>Democratic elections in the various Soviet republics were held in order to generate new elites who would implement economic reform. (Location 635)</p><p>Societies of every Soviet republic believed that they had been exploited by the system to the benefit of other regions. (Location 638)</p><p>Gorbachev’s own legitimacy had come from the party, but he was trying to replace the party with a state. (Location 640)</p><p>The new Russian Federation was established as a constitutional republic, legitimated by democracy, (Location 651)</p><p>Ilyin had anticipated a different transition from Soviet to Russian power: fascist dictatorship, the preservation of all Soviet territory, permanent war against the sinful West. (Location 654)</p><p>The myth of a redeemer would have to be founded on lies so enormous that they could not be doubted, because doubting them would mean doubting everything. (Location 659)</p><p>Democracy never took hold in Russia, in the sense that power never changed hands after freely contested elections. (Location 662)</p><p>Yeltsin simply remained president after independence. To be sure, such an institutionally ambiguous claim to power was typical as the 1990s began. (Location 665)</p><p>the very rich chose Russia’s redeemer. (Location 669)</p><p>Americans, taking the rule of law for granted, could fantasize that markets would create the necessary institutions. (Location 673)</p><p>In 1993, Yeltsin dissolved the Russian parliament and sent armed men against its deputies. (Location 676)</p><p>In 1996, Yeltsin’s team (by its own account) faked elections that won him another term as president. (Location 679)</p><p>“Operation Successor,” as the challenge was known in the Kremlin, had two stages: finding a new man who was not a known associate of Yeltsin, and then inventing a fake problem that he could then appear to solve. (Location 683)</p><p>Vladimir Putin, who had held a meaningless post in the East German provinces during his career in the KGB, was seen as the closest match to the fictional Stierlitz.* (Location 688)</p><p>There was no evidence that Chechens had anything to do with the bombings. (Location 699)</p><p>Thanks to unequal television coverage, manipulation of the vote tally, and the atmospherics of terrorism and war, Putin was accorded the absolute majority needed to win the presidential election of March 2000. (Location 701)</p><p>Credit for the political technology of Operation Successor was taken by Vladislav Surkov, (Location 704)</p><p>During Putin’s first two presidential terms, between 2000 and 2008, Surkov exploited manageable conflicts to gain popularity or change institutions.

(Location 3887)</p><p>Russian leaders had occasion that year to observe as race opened a tremendous gap between the executive and legislative branches of the American government. (Location 3893)</p><p>This level of partisanship, where the enemy is the opposing party and the outside world is neglected, creates a vulnerability easily exploited by hostile actors in that outside world. (Location 3904)</p><p>As Republicans realized that Russia was attacking the United States, the fury of partisanship became the desperation of denial and then the complicity of inaction. (Location 3908)</p><p>After McConnell categorized the Russian attack as partisan politics, its scope expanded. A massive Russian bot offensive began right then. (Location 3915)</p><p>Moscow was attacking, and Congress declined to defend the country. The Obama administration might have acted on its own, but was afraid to deepen partisan divisions. (Location 3919)</p><p>While competing for the 2016 Republican nomination, Ohio governor John Kasich, who was knowledgeable about east European politics, was quick to associate Trump with Putin. (Location 3924)</p><p>Though Obama’s response to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine was indeed very cautious, in 2016 Obama did at least recognize that Russian intervention in a U.S. election was a problem for the country as a whole. Even as Kasich and Rubio took a stand on Russian foreign policy, the crucial Republican legislators surrendered in advance to Russian cyberattack.

(Location 3933)</p><p>Rather than presenting a future with possibilities and hopes, they offer an eternal present with defined enemies and artificial crises. For this to work, citizens have to meet eternity politicians halfway. Demoralized by their inability to change their station in life, they must accept that the meaning of politics lies not in institutional reform but in daily emotion. They must stop thinking about a better future for themselves, their friends, and their families, and prefer the constant invocation of a proud past. (Location 3938)</p><p>At the top and throughout society, material inequality creates the experiences and the sentiments that can be transformed into a politics of eternity. (Location 3942)</p><p>In the 2010s, some of the best of them, in revealing projects such as the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers, showed how unregulated international capitalism was creating sinkholes for national wealth. (Location 3954)</p><p>Much of the Russian national wealth that was supposed to be building the Russian state in the 2000s and 2010s found its way to shell corporations in offshore havens. Many of these were in America. (Location 3959)</p><p>Russians used shell companies to purchase American real estate, often anonymously. In the 1990s, Trump Tower was one of only two buildings in New York City to allow anonymous purchases of apartment units, an opportunity that the Russian mob quickly exploited. (Location 3966)</p><p>These mantras of inevitability provided the cover for the policies that made America more unequal, and inequality more painful. (Location 3975)</p><p>At the same time, the United States was very weak on the basic policies that stabilized middle classes elsewhere: retirement pensions, public education, public transport, health care, paid vacation, and parental leave. (Location 3980)</p><p>Since the 1980s, the tax rates paid by the top 0.1% of American earners fell from about 65% to about 35%, and for the top 0.01% from about 75% to below 25%. (Location 3985)</p><p>In the 2010s, the United States approached the Russian standard of inequality. Although no American oligarchical clan has as yet captured the state, the emergence of such groups in the 2010s (Kochs, Mercers, Trumps, Murdochs) was hard to miss. (Location 3997)</p><p>For many Americans, oligarchy meant the warping of time, the loss of a sense of the future, the experience of every day as repetitive stress.

(Location 4064)</p><p>At the extreme of addiction, the world becomes a mute and isolated experience of pleasure and need. Time collapses into a cycle from this hit to the next one. The shift from the sense that everything is wonderful to the sense that everything is dark and foreboding becomes normal.

The tragedy was that his idea of governance was to transform a dead dream into a zombie nightmare. (Location 4078)</p><p>A leader from the realm of fiction tells lies without remorse or apology, because for him untruth is existence. (Location 4081)</p><p>Trump governed just as he had run for office: as a producer of outrage rather than as a formulator of policy. (Location 4096)</p><p>The idea that German Jews were not part of the German people is how the Holocaust began. (Location 4114)</p><p>“The people” always means, as Trump himself put it, “the real people,” not the entire citizenry, but some chosen group. (Location 4116)</p><p>To sexualize the enemy was to make politics into biological conflict, and to trade the hard work of reform and freedom for endless anxious preening. (Location 4123)</p><p>In the minds of some of Trump’s supporters, the approval of the Holocaust and the endorsement of slavery were intertwined: in a major extreme-Right demonstration, in Charlottesville, Virginia, Nazi and Confederate symbols appeared together. (Location 4131)</p><p>The great American social thinker and historian W. E. B. Du Bois (Location 4140)</p><p>An eternity politician defines foes rather than formulating policies. (Location 4153)</p><p>People get the feeling of winning because they believe that others are losing. (Location 4164)</p><p>Trump was a loser since he could only win thanks to Russia; Republicans were greater losers since he had trapped their party; Democrats were still greater losers since they were excluded from power; and the Americans who suffer from deliberately engineered inequality and health crisis were the greatest losers of all. (Location 4165)</p><p>The politics of eternity converts pain to meaning, and then meaning back into more pain. (Location 4183)</p><p>The dark scenario for American democracy was the possible combination of some shocking act, perhaps one of domestic terrorism, with an election that was then held under a state of emergency, further limiting the right to vote. More than once Trump mused about such a “major event.” (Location 4212)</p><p>Politics is international, but repair must be local. (Location 4221)</p><p>Russian methods of rule appealed to America’s would-be oligarchs. As in Russia, the risk was that fascist ideas would consolidate oligarchy. (Location 4226)</p><p>To break the spell of inevitability, we must see ourselves as we are, not on some exceptional path, but in history alongside others. To avoid the temptation of eternity, we must address our own particular problems, beginning with inequality, with timely public policy.

(Location 4240)</p><p>To see our moment is to step away from the stories supplied for our stupefaction, myths of inevitability and eternity, progress and doom. Life is elsewhere. (Location 4241)</p><p>Inevitability and eternity are not history but ideas within history, ways of experiencing our time that accelerate its trends while slowing our thoughts. (Location 4242)</p><p>The virtues of equality, individuality, succession, integration, novelty, and truth depend each upon all the others, and all of them upon human decisions and actions. (Location 4245)</p><p>Thrown into a world we do not choose, we need equality so that we learn through failure but without resentment. Only collective public policy can create citizens with the confidence of individuals. As individuals we seek to understand what we can and should do together and apart. We might join in a democracy with others who have voted before, and will vote after, and in so doing create a principle of succession and a sense of time. With this assured, we might see our country as one among others, recognize the necessity of integration, and choose its terms. (Location 4248)</p><p>Final truth in this world is unattainable, but its pursuit leads the individual away from unfreedom. (Location 4253)</p><p>Total doubt about all authority is naïveté about the particular authority that reads emotions and breeds cynicism. (Location 4256)</p><p>If a vote truly represents a citizen, then citizens can give time to their state, and the state can give time to citizens. That is the truth of succession. (Location 4260)</p><p>That no country stands alone is the truth of integration. (Location 4262)</p><p>If citizens and residents are recognized by law, then other countries might also be recognized by law. Just as the state requires a principle of succession to exist over time, it needs some form of integration with others to exist in space. (Location 4264)</p><p>In conditions of distrust and isolation, creativity and energy veer towards paranoia and conspiracy, a feverish repetition of the oldest mistakes. We speak of freedom of association, but freedom is association: without it we cannot renew ourselves or challenge our rulers. (Location 4268)</p><p>When inequality is too great, the truth is too much for the miserable, and too little for the privileged. (Location 4270)</p><p>Communication among citizens depends upon equality. (Location 4271)</p><p>the collective data of inequality demand policy. If we do not know just how unequal the distribution of the world’s wealth is, or how much of it is hidden from the state by the wealthy, we cannot know where to begin. (Location 4272)</p><p>If we see history as it is, we see our places in it, what we might change, and how we might do better. We halt our thoughtless journey from inevitability to eternity, and exit the road to unfreedom. We begin a politics of responsibility.
