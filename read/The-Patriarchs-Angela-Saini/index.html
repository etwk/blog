This fearful truth gives me great strength. It protects me from fearing death, or life, or hunger, or nakedness, or destruction. It is this fearful truth which prevents me from fearing the brutality of rulers and policemen.’ Woman at Point Zero by Nawal El Saadawi, 1975 (Location 33)</p><a href=#timeline><h3 id=timeline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Timeline</h3></a><p>Roughly 300,000 BCE – Our species, Homo sapiens, appears in the archaeological record in Africa.

(Location 108)</p><p>in the era of empire, British authorities and Christian missionaries in India were so terrified of Kali, in particular, that nationalist revolutionaries adopted her as a symbol of opposition to colonial rule. (Location 109)</p><p>Whether she’s a reflection of humanity or a subversion of it, the fact that she was imagined at all continues to amaze. (Location 113)</p><p>That desire for a historical precedent tells us something else, too. It hints at how hopeless our lives can feel at times. (Location 123)</p><p>Gendered oppression begins to look like one vast conspiracy stretching all the way back into deep time. Something terrible must have happened in our forgotten past to bring us to where we are now. (Location 126)</p><p>It was in 1680 that the English political theorist Sir Robert Filmer fought to make the case for the divine rule of kings by arguing in his Patriarcha that the state was like a family, (Location 129)</p><p>In Sexual Politics, a classic feminist text of 1970, the American activist Kate Millett defined patriarchy as the control of younger men by older men, as well as the control of women by men more generally. (Location 138)</p><p>The low status of some women has never stopped others in the same society from having enormous wealth or power in their own right. (Location 156)</p><p>‘We would do well to think of biological sex, like biological race,’ she suggested, ‘as an excuse rather than a cause for any sexism we observe.’ (Location 183)</p><p>It’s not in the big, simplistic accounts of history that we discover who we are, but in the margins where people live differently from how we might expect. (Location 185)</p><p>Virtues such as loyalty and honour became recruited into service of these basic goals. Traditions and religions, in turn, developed around the same social codes. (Location 194)</p><p>In the parts of the world where brides left their childhood families to live with their husbands’ families, institutions of marriage appear to have been informed by the widespread, dehumanising practices of captive-taking and slavery. (Location 196)</p><p>Women’s oppression may not have begun in the home, but it did end there. (Location 198)</p><p>There was always resistance and compromise. The changes we see through time are gradual and fitful, stealing into people’s lives over generations until they couldn’t imagine themselves any other way. After all, this is how social transformation usually works: by normalising what would have been unthinkable before. (Location 202)</p><p>power is inventive. Gendered oppression was cooked up and refined not only within societies; it was also deliberately exported for centuries, through proselytism and colonialism. (Location 207)</p><p>Those in power have worked desperately hard over time to give the illusion of solidity to the gendered codes and hierarchies they invented. Today, these myths have become our convictions. (Location 209)</p><p>The biggest challenge has been untangling the mass of assumptions that bog down this subject, disguised as objective knowledge but often turning out to be husks of conjecture. (Location 217)</p><a href=#chapter-one-domination><h3 id=chapter-one-domination><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER ONE Domination</h3></a><p>‘But was there ever any domination which did not appear natural to those who possessed it?’ (Location 226)</p><p>there’s a part of Planet of the Apes that often passes audiences by unnoticed: whether human or ape, males are almost always at the centre of the action. (Location 235)</p><p>The thrill of science fiction should be its licence to break with convention. The radical promise of this genre is that it can help us push back against the world we’re in. (Location 239)</p><p>bonobos are at least as close to us in evolutionary terms as chimpanzees are, making them one of our two nearest genetic relatives in the animal kingdom. (Location 259)</p><p>no bonobo colony has ever been found to have been led by a male, not in captivity, nor in the wild. (Location 260)</p><p>Female leadership is seen not just among bonobos, but also among killer whales, lions, spotted hyenas, lemurs, and elephants. (Location 264)</p><p>When it comes to understanding how dominance works, ‘there is so much we can learn from bonobos’, (Location 265)</p><p>bonobo females form tight social bonds with each other, even when they’re not related, cementing those relationships and easing tensions by rubbing their genitals together. (Location 267)</p><p>These intimate social networks create power, locking out the possibility for individual males to dominate the group. (Location 268)</p><p>by the start of 2020 fourteen countries also had governments in which at least half the ministers were women: (Location 319)</p><p>when animal researchers talk about male dominance, they’re almost always referring to males trying to assert dominance over each other – not over females. (Location 332)</p><p>between males, size and aggression don’t necessarily give them the deciding edge. (Location 334)</p><p>one of those vivid, vivid pictures that strikes you when it’s so out of keeping with what you expect.’ (Location 362)</p><p>Kerala, on the other hand, was wrapped in fable – a place where gender roles were reversed, where women had always ruled, and daughters were prized over sons. (Location 366)</p><p>societies with a matrilineal bias are in fact dotted across Asia, parts of North and South America, and a wide ‘matrilineal belt’ stretching through the middle of Africa. (Location 372)</p><p>Matriliny doesn’t guarantee that women are better treated, or that men won’t be in positions of power and authority, but it is one part of the picture of how a society thinks about gender. (Location 373)</p><p>Proceedings of the Royal Society B (Location 383)</p><p>The Village Before Time, the journalist Madhavan Kutty (Location 386)</p><p>Women were allowed more than one sexual partner, none of whom would necessarily live with her. This meant that fathers weren’t expected to play a big part in raising their own children, but would instead help to raise their sisters’ children. Born into a huge taravad, Kutty recounts that his was a family tree in which only the children of daughters were listed. (Location 389)</p><p>British colonialists who took over the region, together with missionaries looking to convert people to Christianity, pressured matrilineal Keralites to bring gender norms into line with their Victorian sensibilities. (Location 413)</p><p>‘In seeking a psychological advantage over their subjects colonial ideology felt compelled to assert the moral superiority of the rulers in many subtle and not so subtle ways,’ (Location 414)</p><p>Under the matrilineal system, where the sexes were relatively more equal than in a patrilineal system, ‘the monarch’s gender was of little consequence’, writes Pillai. ‘It was the position and its dignity that mattered and whoever exercised supreme authority in the state and in the royal house was held to be the Maharajah.’ (Location 425)</p><p>‘all people sprang from the woman’. Khasis are matrilineal, but, unlike Kerala’s Nairs, their tribal society remains matrilineal to this day. (Location 433)</p><p>‘Traditionally, inheritance among the Khasis flows from mother to daughter, with the youngest daughter getting the bulk of the property,’ adds Nongbri. It becomes her responsibility to take care of her parents and any unmarried siblings. She’s the family’s custodian. (Location 439)</p><p>When Islam arrived, it again gave men fresh routes into positions of authority that they didn’t have before, this time as religious leaders. (Location 474)</p><p>It wasn’t that they were necessarily rejecting matriliny. It was more that they wondered whether life might be better another way. (Location 481)</p><p>But the final blow to the taravad would come in 1976, decades after India’s independence from British rule. That year, the Kerala legislature abolished matriliny altogether. (Location 498)</p><p>Towards the end, people were carried along, noticing what they had lost only after it was gone. (Location 505)</p><p>‘A lot of the hypotheses that we catalogued from the literature didn’t really hold up to a worldwide evolutionary analysis.’ (Location 520)</p><p>As much variation as there is now, there would have been even more in the past. In prehistory, social norms were changing all the time. (Location 530)</p><p>If the only way of thinking about gender and power is a binary opposition between women and men, it becomes impossible to imagine men sharing status and importance with women, or of the balance of power changing with circumstances. But this is often what we have in matrilineal societies. (Location 534)</p><p>Maybe the real puzzle isn’t the existence of a relatively small number of matrilineal societies, but that patriarchal ones have become so common. (Location 544)</p><p>memoir The Kingdom of Women, (Location 546)</p><p>social equality in our own species doesn’t come easily. It takes complex, ongoing negotiation, keeping power, jealousy, and greed in check, sometimes using criticism or ridicule of those in power. (Location 560)</p><p>The most dangerous part of any form of oppression is that it can make people believe that there are no alternatives. (Location 580)</p><a href=#chapter-two-exception><h3 id=chapter-two-exception><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CHAPTER TWO Exception</h3></a><p>‘Feminism’s search for a ground is a search for the truth of all women’s collectivity in the face of the enforced lie that all women are the same.’ (Location 584)</p><p>‘History is a story Western culture buffs tell each other,’ writes the feminist scholar Donna Haraway. (Location 602)</p><p>In 2018, the curators of the museum did something unusual. Acknowledging that the diorama was historically inaccurate, they decided that instead of removing it, they would add large explanatory labels to the window in front. (Location 610)</p><p>Lenape women held leadership roles and acted as keepers of knowledge in the seventeenth century. Modern-day Lenape women still do. (Location 625)</p><p>There were some Europeans who saw Native Americans as savage. There were others who recognised the strengths and beauties of their cultures. But whichever way they were seen, as noble savages or savage savages, depending on the observer’s persuasion, (Location 636)</p><p>The past had been rewritten to serve the myth of ‘Manifest Destiny’, a nation-building origin story that claimed Americans of European descent were destined to move westwards and obtain more land for themselves. (Location 640)</p><p>European intellectuals imagined a transition from savagery to civilisation, from irrationality to rationality, from immorality to morality, as humans were shifting from being governed by nature to themselves governing it. Male authority, then, was believed to be another marker of humanity’s progress. ‘It was Enlightenment doctrine,’ (Location 648)</p><p>European assumptions about race and gender had been imported into the New World by the Founding Fathers, (Location 652)</p><p>For ‘white men, Jefferson emphasized unalienable rights, but when he came to white women, Jefferson shifted focus to natural roles and the happiness of society’. (Location 681)</p><p>American democracy chose to draw the line at women and the enslaved – for the simple reason that neither group was seen as being naturally worthy of having the vote. Indigenous peoples weren’t recognised as citizens in the first place. (Location 684)</p><p>Married women existed as citizens only through their husbands. This meant that as recently as 1922, an American woman could lose her citizenship if she married a foreign man who wasn’t a citizen, (Location 707)</p><p>human societies did not slot into neat models of progress from primitive to advanced. Instead, civilisations could be seen rising and falling over millennia, becoming technological powerhouses and then slipping into dark ages, or surviving with simpler, more sustainable ways for tens of thousands of years. (Location 719)</p><p>Young Navajo girls would run races to prove their strength of character. Seri women from the Mexican state of Sonora could run more than seventy kilometres in a night, (Location 731)</p><p>In 1590, more than 250 years before the famous convention for women’s rights took place at the Wesleyan Chapel on Fall Street, women from across the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Cayuga Nations met to call for peace as war raged between their peoples. (Location 749)</p><p>Since Sky Woman is considered a literal forebear, not a metaphor, it’s taken as fact that everyone’s genealogical line begins with her and travels through their mothers. (Location 764)</p><p>Clan mothers still help run the local level of government, from which political power radiates out to the federal level. They are the ones who select honorary male chiefs to lead their clans, influencing their decisions and wielding the power to oust them if they do not do a good job. Myers tells me that a chief is nothing like a king or absolute ruler. ‘He’s working for the people. He’s not working above them or below them, but he’s working with them.’ (Location 767)</p><p>When Indigenous people began learning English after colonisation, he added, they would routinely ‘speak of a man as she, and a woman as he’. They swapped the pronouns, consciously or subconsciously, because they could see that he represented the most important gender in the English language. (Location 775)</p><p>There are others who believe their forebears recognised four, five, or perhaps more manifestations of gender, which they suggest might correspond to something like gay, lesbian, ‘feminine’ man and ‘masculine’ woman. (Location 788)</p><p>‘Democracy itself was learned from the Haudenosaunee. A lot of their symbolism within their government was stolen from our peoples.’ Official recognition of this came in October 1988, (Location 797)</p><p>when Christopher Columbus set sail for the New World from Spain, the Haudenosaunee ‘already had several hundred years of democracy, organized democracy. We had a constitution here based on peace, based on equity and justice, based on unity and health.’ (Location 801)</p><p>How Morgan’s theories were read depended on the reader; in particular, on the reader’s politics.
