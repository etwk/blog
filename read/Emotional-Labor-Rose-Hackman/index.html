(Location 47)</p><p>What was important— I had known immediately upon picking up the phone— was conveying that the situation was under control to him, even if it wasn’t yet. (Location 73)</p><p>women across the world are taught from a very young age to regulate, modulate, and manipulate their feelings in order to have a positive effect on the feelings of others. Women, endlessly told to smile but also tasked with making other people smile, are held accountable not only for the expression of their own feelings but also for the feelings of others. (Location 91)</p><p>This is emotional labor: the primordial training that, before anything else, women and girls should edit the expression of their emotions to accommodate and elevate the emotions of others. (Location 102)</p><p>Sociologist Arlie Hochschild first coined the term four decades ago to describe the skill American workers were required to perform in the service sector as it was exploding and slowly replacing the manufacturing one. (Location 103)</p><p>With these ongoing emotion-geared performances, our position as women in both professional and personal settings is firmly established in the world: the caregiver, the appeaser, the listener, the empath, the subordinate. (Location 114)</p><p>As of 2019, women represented half of the college-educated workforce. (Location 124)</p><p>We are in fact still living in the midst of a thriving patriarchy. (Location 131)</p><p>Men are still considered heads of households. When men are absent from households, the household becomes regarded as an incomplete, defective unit. 6 (Location 141)</p><p>During the worst years of the COVID-19 epidemic, economists reported that women were quitting their jobs at twice the rate men were. (Location 157)</p><p>Humans need to be fed, dressed, housed, educated, tended to, and cared for, and they need to feel meaning, belonging, and connection to be able to function in an economy. (Location 176)</p><p>In the words of radical feminist Heidi Hartmann, “the material base upon which patriarchy rests lies most fundamentally in men’s control over women’s labor power.” (Location 178)</p><p>One of the cleverest tricks of patriarchy is that it transforms all work deemed feminine into fixed, subliminal expressions of femininity— however much that work involves active time, effort, and skill. (Location 180)</p><p>Emotional labor as a more gendered burden has been depicted explicitly many times in fictional works by women— whether in the novel Sula by Toni Morrison, or The Wife by Meg Wolitzer, (Location 201)</p><p>This is a form of work that is imposed on those who lack power, obscured, and then used to keep them in place. (Location 212)</p><p>Emotional Labor is the product of seven years of inquiry, five of which were spent in intense reading, research, reflection, and confrontation, including through hundreds of interviews in person, over the phone, and via email. (Location 218)</p><p>Emotional labor is a global phenomenon, but its iteration in the United States has roots in a brand of patriarchy and white supremacy brought to the country by its former colonizer. (Location 234)</p><p>and love in action as forces that can lead us forward and call all of us into the best of our humanity. (Location 240)</p><a href=#one-what-is-emotional-labor-exactly><h3 id=one-what-is-emotional-labor-exactly><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ONE What Is Emotional Labor, Exactly?</h3></a><p>Mother’s Day, a day that ended up being about everything except putting her feet up and being celebrated, (Location 246)</p><p>Jennifer had noticed that her husband of ten years, Shawn, who was generally closed off with his feelings, was acting more distant and down. Jennifer slowly, skillfully convinced him to share what was in his heart. “If you don’t open up, you’re going to be like a bottle of pop that you shake and shake and shake and eventually you explode,” (Location 257)</p><p>Every now and then, as she goes into the layers of uncompensated work she does, her tone starts to sound more pleading and her descriptions sound like questions, like she is clear that what she is doing is there but she needs someone, anyone, to hear her, to see her, to mark what she is doing as real. (Location 305)</p><p>Performing emotional labor— identifying or anticipating other people’s emotions, adapting yours in consequence, and then managing to positively affect other people’s emotions (Location 310)</p><p>emotional labor— just like physical labor, intellectual labor, and creative labor— is a form of work that does require time, effort, and skill. (Location 322)</p><p>Or whether it is someone else, and we are proclaiming our own innocence and ignorance, while engaging in subtle arm-twisting to get them to get a task done, followed by restrained gratitude when it is done (Location 337)</p><p>Her life’s work having a term was deeply validating, and also relieving. It hadn’t all been in her head; her exhaustion did not mean she was morally deficient. (Location 352)</p><p>Men and women are perfectly able to perform emotional labor, but the expectations placed on women are far greater than those placed on men, resulting in a notable penalty-versus-credit gulf. (Location 363)</p><p>Psychological essentialism still reigns supreme for many people (Location 375)</p><p>our persistent cultural stereotypes that maintain that women and men have impeccably opposing personality traits. Under this dogma, women are cast as empathetic, emotional, insightful, warm, expressive, other-directed, interpersonally adept, and more aware of the feelings of others, while men are cast as more dominant, rational, active, decisive, performance- and status-driven, hierarchy-aware, self-directed, selfish, and less aware of the feelings of others. (Location 377)</p><p>Cognitive neuroscientist Gina Rippon, author of The Gendered Brain: The New Neuroscience That Shatters the Myth of the Female Brain, (Location 382)</p><p>today’s science shows that brains are prodigiously affected by social cues and stereotypes and react to them, not the opposite. (Location 384)</p><p>Human brains have the ability to constantly evolve and be taught new tricks or skill sets. But their permeability means they are also heavily affected by context and environment. (Location 390)</p><p>Men’s and women’s brains are not the cause for the status quo then; they are the product of it. (Location 394)</p><p>Social scientists and psychologists have found that there is a “backlash” effect toward people who veer from cultural, gendered stereotypes. Openly sensitive men risk being branded as weak, incompetent, suspicious, or even dishonorable, and openly ambitious women risk being branded strident, untrustworthy, malicious, unbalanced, and even dangerous. (Location 400)</p><p>studies that found that women and men exhibited similar degrees of empathic ability, finding a difference favoring women only when participants knew they were being tested on a trait deemed feminine, (Location 412)</p><p>suggesting that greater empathic accuracy can be achieved by virtually anyone who is given proper motivation. (Location 421)</p><p>If you think of what emotional labor is— putting other people and their feelings above yourself and your own— it is remarkably similar to the idea of serving. (Location 433)</p><p>those designated as “subordinate”— whether male or female— were consistently more attentive and perceptive to the feelings of leaders, (Location 439)</p><p>“The prevailing power imbalance between males and females within a culture might actually be sustained and facilitated if the more powerful members of the culture require the less powerful members to ‘read their minds,’ (Location 443)</p><p>that we mirror one another as humans and that emotions are infectious. (Location 463)</p><p>because emotional labor is the act of putting other people’s feelings before one’s own, it can also provoke the taking on of essential tasks other people may be able to do but find undesirable or unrewarding, (Location 481)</p><p>For the last couple of decades, time-use surveys capturing the population’s paid and unpaid work have been undertaken in the United States following years of campaigning caused by international feminist economics thinking. (Location 494)</p><p>This system of experiential inequality and unequal emotional labor distribution is propped up in private by absurd double standards we have become all too well acquainted with, even as we let them slide. (Location 521)</p><p>Emotional labor is the ultimate enabler of work. A loved, educated, well-fed, healthy, and socialized young adult goes into the world a capable worker thanks to years of labor put into their shaping— and years more dedicated to their maintenance and uplifting. (Location 538)</p><p>white managers, who often police her tone and appearance— leaving her with no choice but to filter the expression of her emotions to please her surroundings and keep her position. (Location 548)</p><p>After some boys started bullying her for her looks, Ashley noticed her young daughter internalizing more and more negative messages about herself. Her grades started to fall, and Bri began to believe she was dumb. (Location 558)</p><p>she is bent on breaking hers. She does it day in and day out “by speaking up, standing for what’s right, going above and beyond,” (Location 582)</p><a href=#two-domesticity-at-work><h3 id=two-domesticity-at-work><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>TWO Domesticity at Work</h3></a><p>That first COVID-19-pandemic shift, there was little reassurance outside of her own to be found. No one had a plan; (Location 602)</p><p>As a patient care technician, a job also referred to as a nursing assistant, she was expected to take patients’ vitals every four hours, (Location 605)</p><p>Registered nurses, nursing assistants like Lucy, personal care aides, and home health aides, each position overwhelmingly occupied by women at rates of eight to nine out of every ten, are all on the list of the Bureau of Labor Statistics top twenty occupations with the most projected job growth over the next decade. (Location 618)</p><p>Lower in the hierarchy of the hospital compared to doctors or nurses, she felt thrown in the deep end, expected to be the caregiver in a context that was blatantly not caring for her. (Location 635)</p><p>the prestige didn’t translate into much beyond pot banging. In the United States, for all the buzz of federal hazard pay that had initially proposed increasing essential workers’ salaries by an extra $ 13 per hour, which would have almost doubled Lucy’s income, proposals never concretized. (Location 649)</p><p>Loudly stating the value of feminized work places another veil in front of the fact that we chronically refuse to pay for the work of people meeting our most essential needs. (Location 663)</p><p>as humans, our existence is primarily reliant on our emotional needs being met. Love, a sense of connection, and belonging could not be more valuable to humans thriving— more so than the food that we eat or the roof over our heads. (Location 666)</p><p>the rules of our economy are not evenly applied depending on who is doing the work and what kind of work is being done. This is a rigged system that relies on social beliefs that are far more brutal and retrograde than we would care to admit. (Location 675)</p><p>a core dynamic of care as a human activity: coercion. Physical, economic, social, and moral pressures are all used to induce people into performances based on what she called “status obligations,” which are often tied to gender and also compounded by race and class. (Location 677)</p><p>Starting in the nineteenth century, most forms of work became based in an understanding of exchange rather than an expression of status. (Location 683)</p><p>Care, however, unlike other kinds of work, has remained what Glenn calls “pre-modern” from a labor perspective. This means that care, including its core performance of emotional labor, has retained the attributes of being a “forced gift,” holding barely any requirement or expectation for compensation, recognition, or exchange. (Location 687)</p><p>In the restaurant industry, itself the employer of 10 percent of Americans, most establishment owners do not pay servers and bartenders a full wage. They pay them a tipped subminimum wage, which stands at $ 2.13 an hour federally to this day. (Location 694)</p><p>Servers are making a living almost entirely off emotional labor. But it is seen as totally acceptable for that emotional labor to not be paid for by employers. (Location 706)</p><p>Being given weekend and dinner shifts instead of early week and lunch shifts can double, even triple what you take home at the end of the week— less than $ 200 for a week’s work versus upward of $ 600. (Location 717)</p><p>Economists call “feminization of labor” the refusal to recognize and fully compensate feminine fields of work— such as care, service, and attention work— that are becoming the bulk of the economy. (Location 722)</p><p>Dianne Avery, a professor emerita at the University of Buffalo School of Law, described tipping practices as gendered, feudal throwbacks. “What tipped workers represent for the moment of that exchange is an intimate master– servant relation,” (Location 728)</p><p>it’s their dependency on a customer’s uncertain magnanimity— because their emotional labor is not seen as necessarily worthy of exchange— that puts them in a spot that feels compromising to the core. (Location 739)</p><p>old-fashioned, classist, and racist views dating back to the nineteenth century still expect respectable women— in other words white middle- or upper-class women— to stay home, and women working in drinking establishments to be sex workers. (Location 750)</p><p>Women may now occupy close to half of the formal workforce, but public spaces are still seen as male, so when women enter them, it is still assumed to be according to men’s rules, for the male gaze, or for male entertainment. (Location 753)</p><p>Sandberg’s message was clear and empowering: with the right kind of individual attitude, personal life choices, and toning down of apologetic feminine behaviors, women could finally move forward, and up. (Location 788)</p><p>“They told me the only way you are going to get ahead in the corporate world is to boost the male egos around you”— a form of emotional labor, making male colleagues and superiors feel good, specifically tied to affirming their power. (Location 811)</p><p>For men, being perceived as competent and confident were the two ingredients that led them to gain influence, opening the doors to rise up. Do well and act like you know what you are doing: a simple recipe. (Location 835)</p><p>If women wanted to gain influence in the same way as their male counterparts did, they needed to also possess and display what is known in organizational psychology as “prosocial orientation.” (Location 837)</p><p>In order to modulate the backlash, and not be seen as too hungry for power or too eager to get ahead, women have to play a game of compensation. As they assert themselves as competent and confident, they must also dole out doses of reassuring emotional labor. (Location 857)</p><p>because deference and filtering of emotions go with power, in traditional work environments, the higher up you go, the less emotional labor you absolutely have to do. (Location 886)</p><p>Failing to treat emotional intelligence in action as a form of work that requires time, effort, and skill the same way other forms of work do meant that only some select workers were lauded for its performance.

When I ask her what her job involves exactly, she tells me it “entails everything” tied to Mia: being in charge of her scheduling, clothes, food, schooling, her general well-being, and her emotional, intellectual, and physical development. (Location 933)</p><p>Anna’s emotional labor to the child in her care also involves providing her with an environment for emotional development, emotional exploration, and emotional literacy as she processes the world around her with prodigious sensitivity, ability, and speed. Sensory feelings must be given explanations and translated into emotions that must be given words.
