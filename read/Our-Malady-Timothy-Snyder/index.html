Malaise and malady are good old words, from French and Latin, used in English for hundreds of years; in American Revolutionary times they meant both illness and tyranny. (Location 50)</p><p>Our malady is physical illness and the political evil that surrounds it. We are ill in a way that costs us freedom, and unfree in a way that costs us health. (Location 55)</p><p>In five hospitals over three months, between December 2019 and March 2020, I took notes and made sketches. (Location 65)</p><p>The rage was beautifully pure, undefiled by an object. (Location 76)</p><p>I raged therefore I was. (Location 81)</p><p>Death would extinguish my sense of how things could and should be, of the possible and beautiful. (Location 90)</p><p>A visit helps us to be alone. Being together in solidarity permits a return to solitude in tranquility. (Location 99)</p><p>the ways my children’s lives were bound to my own. What mattered was not that I was distinct, but that I was theirs: their father. Every bit of their existence involved the expectation of my presence. They had never not touched me. Their planks had always been bound to mine. (Location 112)</p><p>The empathy placed me among others. In this mood, it was not so important that I was special. It was important that I was inside other people, in their memories and expectations, a support in the shape of their lives, a buoy during difficult passages. Since my life was not just my own, then my death was not just my own. (Location 121)</p><p>I needed the torch and the raft, the fire and the water, the solitude and the solidarity, to get well, to be free. (Location 126)</p><a href=#introduction-our-malady><h3 id=introduction-our-malady><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>INTRODUCTION Our Malady</h3></a><p>The mortality rate of babies borne by African American women is higher than in Albania, Kazakhstan, China, and about seventy other countries. (Location 134)</p><p>Our system of commercial medicine, dominated by private insurance, regional groups of private hospitals, and other powerful interests, looks more and more like a numbers racket. (Location 140)</p><p>If birth is not safe, and is less safe for some than for others, then something is wrong. (Location 142)</p><p>The purpose of medicine is not to squeeze maximum profits from sick bodies during short lives, but to enable health and freedom during long ones. (Location 144)</p><p>By 2020, when I was fifty, the difference in life expectancy had grown to four years. It is not that other countries have more knowledge or better doctors. It is that they have better systems. (Location 150)</p><p>their governments treated them better, and because they had better access to information and care. (Location 153)</p><p>Our botching of a pandemic is the latest symptom of our malady, of a politics that deals out pain and death rather than security and health, profit for a few rather than prosperity for the many. (Location 155)</p><p>A virus is not human, but it is a measure of humanity. (Location 160)</p><p>Our malady makes pollution deaths, opioid deaths, prison deaths, suicides, newborn deaths, and now mass graves for the elderly all too familiar. (Location 161)</p><p>To be free is to become ourselves, to move through the world following our values and desires. Each of us has a right to pursue happiness and to leave a trace. Freedom is impossible when we are too ill to conceive (Location 165)</p><p>Freedom is sometimes a scream in the dark, a will to go on, a solitary rage. (Location 172)</p><p>a person wanting to be free over the course of a life also needs calm voices, friendly visits, confidence that illness will bring attention and not abandonment. (Location 172)</p><p>Freedom is about each of us, and yet none of us is free without help. Individual rights require common effort. (Location 175)</p><p>A right is something that we are convinced we deserve, but it only becomes real in the world when forced upon the powers that be.

Health care is a human right.</h3></a><p>I was in a condition known as sepsis; death was close. The nurses guarding the entrance to the emergency room did not seem to take me seriously, (Location 197)</p><p>Like most American emergency departments, this one was overflowing, with beds lining the hallways. (Location 202)</p><p>Getting attention in emergency rooms is a matter of figuring out who staff are and catching someone’s eye. (Location 205)</p><p>racism hurt my life chances that night; it hurts others’ life chances every moment of their lives. (Location 212)</p><p>emergency departments in the evening are full of older alcoholics and younger people who have been stabbed or shot. (Location 213)</p><p>The doctors and nurses seemed unable to complete a sentence, let alone think about my case as something with a history. (Location 231)</p><p>When I concentrate on what I read, I have a very good memory. Much of my thirties and forties I spent reading first-person accounts of the Holocaust and other German crimes, Stalinist mass shootings and famine, ethnic cleansings, and other atrocities. (Location 265)</p><p>Something in me paused over a Jewish orphan taken in by childless Ukrainian peasants: “You will be like a daughter to us,” they said, she remembered, I remembered. (Location 269)</p><p>Life is not just inside people; it passes through people. (Location 278)</p><p>The permanent distraction of doctors and nurses is a symptom of our malady. (Location 284)</p><p>People are much poorer at almost every task when they are close to a cell phone; both physicians had kept theirs turned on and close by. (Location 296)</p><p>Like everything that happened, this wasn’t my bad luck. It is the nature of the system that doctors are harried and make mistakes. (Location 306)</p><p>After my postoperative care was mishandled, I underwent another procedure on my liver, to add two more drains. (Location 314)</p><p>nerve damage caused by my immune system when it reacted to an overwhelming threat. (Location 317)</p><p>If some Americans have access to health care thanks to wealth or connections, they will feel pleased because they are included and others are not. Such a feeling turns our human concern about health into a silent yet profound inequality that undermines democracy. (Location 322)</p><p>When everyone has access to decent care at minimal cost, as is true for almost all of the developed world, it is easier to see fellow citizens as equal. (Location 324)</p><p>If everyone can assume that treatment will be available when necessary, they can turn their minds and their resources to other matters, make freer choices, pursue greater happiness. (Location 330)</p><p>When health care is competitive the winners do wrong to others, but they also get worse care themselves. (Location 336)</p><p>As I stepped back from death, I was looking for easy ways to bridge the gap between what I wanted to do and what I could do, (Location 344)</p><p>The Nazis treated health care as a way to divide the humans from the subhumans and nonhumans. If we see others as bearers of ailments and ourselves as healthy victims, we are little better than they. (Location 359)</p><p>If we truly oppose the Nazi evil, we will try to think our way to its opposite, to the good. (Location 360)</p><p>Stalin’s Gulag was run according to this logic of reverse health care. Because Soviet administrators regarded prisoners as economic units, health care was distributed according to calculations about productivity. (Location 364)</p><p>The constitution of the World Health Organization, founded in 1946, states: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.” (Location 374)</p><p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 states: “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.” (Location 376)</p><p>Perhaps my grandfathers complained about pain during their working lives. But I can’t imagine their doing so. No one ever told me directly not to talk about pain, but I took this in very young. (Location 392)</p><p>Before there were medicines that worked to halt migraines (triptans), I found myself in the emergency room every few weeks, (Location 403)</p><p>When I got sick in December 2019, my diffidence about pain was unhelpful. (Location 405)</p><p>When my appendix burst I did not realize what had happened and ignored the pain: after all, I had been told that I had an infection and that it would hurt for a while. (Location 409)</p><p>My tolerance of pain comes from the same place as the rage that saved my life. It has helped me to do work that I value. Yet enduring pain in silence also creates a vulnerability, (Location 414)</p><p>We can slip from silence about pain to silence about addiction, as millions of Americans have done. (Location 417)</p><p>My brother, a physicist who has had to undergo several surgeries, says that opioids are harder on his brain than the procedures and the anesthesia. (Location 423)</p><p>The neurologist, who examined me carefully and ran tests, suggested that my worsening condition had to do with separation from people I loved. As a young man, I thought that he was either being very French or making fun of me. It took time for me to realize that he was onto something. (Location 432)</p><p>The difference is not that we have fancy chemicals and the Europeans do not. The difference is that doctors in Europe have time to do something beyond write out prescriptions. (Location 444)</p><p>Medication is important, but it has its limits. (Location 450)</p><p>In our country, where pharmaceutical advertisements are the main source of health information, we keep learning the lesson that suffering is our personal responsibility and that pills are the cure. (Location 457)</p><p>Suffering and self-medicating are both lonely activities; they can feel like free choices, but they create an imbalance that leaves us in bondage. (Location 459)</p><p>the four decades after the war were an era of upward social mobility. The last four decades have been tough. The number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979. (Location 466)</p><p>Small farming is becoming untenable as a way of life. Farmers, the men who seemed invulnerable to me as a kid, now kill themselves in higher numbers than people in just about any other line of work. (Location 469)</p><p>The welfare state, meant to complement the solitude of ambition with the solidarity of support, has been taken apart. (Location 472)</p><p>Until the 1980s, American fathers who worked hard could expect better life chances for their children. That is no longer true. (Location 474)</p><p>It used to be that American politicians competed with visions of a brighter future. Now a good deal of our politics is the solicitation and manipulation of pain. (Location 477)</p><p>Pill mills are doctors’ offices where physicians do nothing but prescribe opioids, usually in exchange for cash. (Location 480)</p><p>If all we have is lonely rage, we fail, become addicted, listen to the wrong people, harm those we care about, and die. (Location 487)</p><p>The one piece of information that best predicts whether Mr. Trump won or lost a county in November 2016 was the degree of opioid abuse. (Location 490)</p><p>Desperate voters close off care to themselves, their families, and everyone else by voting for politicians who traffic in pain. (Location 495)</p><p>Once pride becomes resentment, we forget that we need help and claim that only others do. (Location 498)</p><p>They want people staggered by suffering, and so they oppose health care. Pain is their politics; their propaganda is a death trap. (Location 501)</p><p>But hypocrisy is the least of their sins. Flattering while denying care adds sadism to manslaughter. (Location 507)</p><p>Between the choice to live in pain and the choice to take pills, there should be a world of alternatives: health care that we can find, or that can find us. (Location 512)</p><p>If we are concerned about American health, and American freedom, then everyone should be insured, and everyone’s insurance should cover what helps to relieve pain. (Location 515)</p><p>It is tempting to find meaning in suffering and death. (Location 520)</p><p>Brutal amputations were common, pus and swelling were misunderstood as signs of healing rather than infection, and burns were treated by bleeding the patient. (Location 535)</p><p>Jefferson thought that health was the most important element of a good life, after morality. (Location 544)</p><p>its authors had the wisdom to specify that “the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” This leaves room for a right to health care. (Location 546)</p><p>We are not free when we are sick. And when we are in pain, or when we are anxious about illness to come, rulers seize upon our suffering, lie to us, and strip away our other freedoms. (Location 550)</p><a href=#lesson-2-renewal-begins-with-children><h3 id=lesson-2-renewal-begins-with-children><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>LESSON 2. Renewal begins with children.</h3></a><p>One night I woke from a nightmare to the realization that my photographs of their first few years of life were not backed up. (Location 564)</p><p>That pregnancy and birth, the first for Marci and me, created a sense of what good health care felt like from the inside: intimate and inexpensive. (Location 574)</p><p>Throughout the pregnancy (and after the birth) my wife carried a handy “mother-child passport,” recognized throughout the country, where doctor visits, test results, and inoculations were recorded. (Location 577)</p><p>Austrians usually speak a neutral version of German to foreigners, but in intimate settings switch to dialect, which is harder to understand. (Location 581)</p><p>In the United States, one often has the feeling that there is a hidden logic dictating events, because there is: a logic of profit. In Austria, it was clear that the goal was the welfare of the unborn child. Prenatal visits were mandatory, in exchange for access to the welfare state. (Location 587)</p><p>After the birth, mother and baby were required to remain in the hospital for ninety-six hours. The idea was to ensure that newborns got a good start and that mothers learned how to breastfeed. (Location 597)</p><p>The nurses were not interested in how the mothers felt about breastfeeding; they had a program to make sure that breastfeeding began. (Location 602)</p><p>About ninety percent of mothers in Austria learn how to breastfeed. (Location 604)</p><p>My relative satisfaction with health care that was less terrible than others’ kept me from seeing how disastrous the entire system was, and how much better it could be. (Location 616)</p><p>it is important to acknowledge how policy changes practices, and how practices change norms. (Location 622)</p><p>The horrors of the twentieth century had made German a language of death. As old ladies on the sidewalk complimented me on my beautiful child, German became a language of life. (Location 626)</p><p>In large matters and small, machine protocols get between patients and their caretakers. The computer programs are about billing, and (Location 633)</p><p>In the United States one has to have good insurance or spare cash to see a lactation consultant, and most people do not. In this way, inequality affects the biology of babies from their first hours. (Location 654)</p><p>we were stunned at the quality of the public preschool in our working-class neighborhood.

(Location 825)</p><p>No one likes bad news; an unchecked ruler never hears what he should from his yes-men; he then projects fictions, which he may actually believe, upon everyone else. This leads to suffering and death, which means more bad news, and so the cycle starts again.

First, we believe a tyrant who tells us that we are immune because we are innocent and superior; then, when we get sick, we believe that we must have been unfairly attacked by someone else, since we are innocent and superior. The tyrant who lied to us about our immunity and superiority then tries to gather power from our suffering and resentment.

As we lose the people who produce facts, we are in danger of losing the very idea of truth.
