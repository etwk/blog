## From Others

Four things. Make a difference about something other than yourselves. - Toni Morrison. Toni Morrison: The Last Interview and Other Conversations

## Personal

Personal experiences and guidelines.
## Community
- Stay away from online Chinese community that moderators actively engages. Usually they inherit some bad authoritarian models. Especially if they have done the Chinese government ICP registration.

## Information
- Evaluate time spending carefully as it is a valuable resource.
- Evaluate information quality level. If we spend much time on low-quality-level information we might normalize the low-quality and forget there are a lot much better information.

## Money
- The world is wild and will continue to be so. For every penny that going to spend think carefully is the cause worthy beforehand.
