# VISA

2022.10

Me as a Chinese passport holder, can choose from e-VISA or VISA-on-arrival. E-VISA valid for 3 months and allow stay for up to 30 days. My e-VISA took 2 days to issue and costs 36 USD.

There are seems some network issue with the e-VISA website https://evisa.gov.kh, if you can't access it from your daily network, better check with https://www.isitdownrightnow.com.
