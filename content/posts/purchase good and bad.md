Here I list some of my good and bad purchase decisions.

## Good
### Phone
#### Google Pixel 6
Got this wile I was in China from a seller in Taobao, a little higher compare to purchase directly from Google but saved a lot of time and energy.

Installed GrapheneOS, no root:
- Have been use for a few years, works great.
- I realize I don't need root on my daily machine after all.
- All features I need such as Google suits works.
- More security orientated enhancements.
- OTA works quite good and usually a few every month, just need to restart after all done.
- Able to isolate a virtual space (use the personal and work feature) and put all less secure apps there, use Shelter to freeze them automatically.

Added anti-scattering film:
- It works good, eyes in other direction other than direct or front above the screen only sees black.
- Pixel 6 place fingerprint sensor underneath screen, it usually does not work after apply the film, but all apps I use do not enforce use of fingerprint sensor, no much problem.

#### iPhone 8
Usually can get a second hand one at price less than 150 USD, recent iOS 16 OS available. Jailbreak available.

It's good for experiment with iOS, jailbreak make it more fun. Try iOS device, it's a very different experience compare to Android phone.

If upgrade to the latest iOS 16, jailbreak requires pass-code not set, not secure for daily machine. So do not upgrade if you found one with older OS.
