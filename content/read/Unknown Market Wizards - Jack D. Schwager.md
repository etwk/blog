## Highlights
There is no such thing as being right or beating the market. If you make money, it is because you understood the same thing as the market did. (Location 45)

Every decade has its characteristic folly, but the basic cause is the same: people persist in believing that what has happened in the recent past will go on happening into the indefinite future, even while the ground is shifting under their feet. —George J. Church (Location 50)

### Preface to the Revised Edition
reducing your exposure when your trading is out of sync with the markets is critical to long-term success. (Location 75)

his Factor market letter (Location 178)

Brandt was sleepwalking. The “chair” was actually the railing of the upper deck. He clambered past the obstacle, and the next thing he knew, he was flat on his back, unable to move. Brandt had fallen nearly 20 feet. (Location 191)

the Sonora desert, which is surprisingly verdant, having more plant species than any other desert in the world, some of which grow nowhere else, such as the iconic saguaro cactus. (Location 199)

in the late 1960s and early 1970s, US citizens were not allowed to own gold, but you could own silver coins. (Location 217)

they were high-level connections. They knew me well, and it so happened that all these major food processors had not hedged during the big bull market in commodities we had just seen. (Location 275)

“I look at the markets through the lens of History 101, Economics 101, and Psychology 101.” (Location 360)

While he was buying into weakness, he wouldn’t just put on a full position and hold it. He would probe the market for a low. He would get out of any trade that had a loss at the end of the week and then try again the next time he thought the timing was right. (Location 373)

“There are two parts to a trade: direction and timing. And, if you’re wrong about either one, you’re wrong on the trade.” (Location 379)

if you could protect your capital, you would always have another shot. But you had to protect your pile of chips. (Location 383)

when a chart pattern fails, that is a more reliable signal than the chart pattern itself. (Location 395)

I was really speaking my charts, but I was giving them my opinion in terms of fundamentals. (Location 413)

[A whipsaw market is a market in which prices swing widely back and forth, causing trend-following traders to be positioned wrong right before the market abruptly reverses direction.] (Location 433)

[A breakout is a price movement above or below a prior trading range (sideways movement in prices) or consolidation pattern (e.g., triangle, flag, etc.). (Location 438)

I used to trade any pattern I could see. I would trade 30 to 35 patterns a month. Now, I am much more selective. (Location 457)

With horizontal boundaries, you can find out much more quickly whether you are right or wrong. (Location 460)

What happens if you buy a breakout, and the market reacts enough to trigger your stop but then holds, and the longer-term pattern still looks good? I will take a second chance but never more than a second chance. And I won’t take the second chance on the same day. (Location 467)

It depends on the market. I wouldn’t use an overnight stop for the Mexican peso, but I would use one for the euro because it is so liquid. (Location 489)

I now know that I am my own worst enemy and that my natural instincts will often lead me astray. I am an impulsive person. (Location 510)

instead of being bothered by losing on a trade, you’re proud that you can take these small losses that prevent a large loss from accumulating. (Location 544)

when I was trading my own account, it was like trading monopoly money. My trading capital was just something I kept score with. I detached myself emotionally from it. (Location 675)

I am fortunate that I have trading peers I can speak to who will be honest with me. (Location 698)

it is best to liquidate any trade that shows an open loss as of the Friday close. (Location 830)

when you have a big move down, the first rally never holds. If there is ever a case where I want to sell into strength, it would be the first rally after a straight-line drop. Often the rally will last for only two days after the reversal day. (Location 900)

Dan had what he called the dominant fundamental factor theory, which postulated that, over an extended period, one to five years, there was one underlying fundamental factor that was the driver of the market. All the other news merely caused gyrations around the trend driven by the dominant fundamental factor, and, more often than not, conventional wisdom didn’t have a clue about what the relevant fundamental factor was. (Location 965)

if people were aware of the dominant factor at all, in most instances, they were trying to fade it. (Location 968)

“If you lost everything you put in, would it meaningfully change your lifestyle?” If it would, don’t trade. If you’re not a good problem solver, don’t trade. (Location 977)

Learn not to take a loss personally. The markets don’t care about who you are. (Location 988)

Can you define with high specificity what trade you’re willing to take a swing at? (Location 1009)

if I wait long enough, there’s always another great trade that will set up. (Location 1026)

They risk way too much. They don’t have a methodology. They chase markets. They have a fear of missing out. They can’t keep their emotions in check; they have wild swings between excitement and depression. (Location 1034)

“If you’re playing for emotional satisfaction, you’re bound to lose, because what feels good is often the wrong thing to do.” (Location 1078)

increases in account equity should be gradual to make sure that the trader is comfortable with the increased trading size. (Location 1100)

Traders who make the transition from trading their own account to managing money should be closely attuned to whether managing other people’s assets impacts their mental comfort level in making trading decisions. (Location 1106)

Cut your trading size, substantially if necessary, until you are once again in sync with the markets. (Location 1125)

discretionary traders should categorize their trades and monitor trade outcomes for each category, so they will have the hard data to know what does and doesn’t work. (Location 1142)

Be sure you really want to trade. And don’t confuse wanting to be rich with wanting to trade. Unless you love the endeavor, you are unlikely to succeed. (Location 1171)

Rather than suddenly switch from daily to weekly charts in 2025, I am starting to experiment with the idea now to give myself a couple of years to see if I can make trading on weekly charts work— (Location 1202)

If you could only trade one market, which market would it be? Eurodollars, 11 if we’re not at a zero interest-rate policy with the Fed. (Location 1225)

as a trader, you have to be able to forgive yourself. If you can’t, you’re in trouble because a mistake can then impact your next trade, which can then affect the trade after that, and so on. (Location 1245)

#### Jason Shapiro: The Contrarian
If you felt there was a significant chance you might decide against approval regardless of whether or not you like the chapter I write, you should let me know. If, however, it’s simply a matter of your not approving if you don’t like the finished product, I am not concerned about that.” (Location 1321)

I thought kids were supposed to hate school, so I did. I thought kids were supposed to rebel against teachers, so I did. (Location 1336)

My mother was a child psychologist, oddly enough, and her attitude was— and I thank her to this day for it— let him be, and eventually, he’ll grow up and find himself. (Location 1340)

In college, I took a liking to economics. It just made sense to me. In my last two years of college, I was reading a new economics or business book virtually every few days. In my senior year, I was also working almost a full-time job in real estate. (Location 1359)

I graduated in 1988 when Japan was booming. I had taken Japanese in college, and someone told me about Japan needing English teachers. I went to Japan with my girlfriend and taught English there for about a year. While I was in Japan, I applied for a job at HSBC. I went to Hong Kong to interview for their executive development program, and I got the job. It was a five-year program where they rotated you to different departments. (Location 1364)

These guys work on their own time. They were super contrarians. It didn’t matter what other people thought. Politics didn’t matter. (Location 1388)

Then the bull market ended. Within six months, I blew out the entire account. All I had left was the Porsche. (Location 1405)

[Nick Leeson was a trader for Barings Bank who was able to successfully hide a string of mounting losses. By the time his deception was uncovered, he had lost $ 1.4 billion, causing the collapse of Barings Bank.] (Location 1407)

Here I was going through all the trouble of getting charts faxed every day and trading every day, and then I make far more money because I am away in Africa and can’t see or do anything. (Location 1426)

Another trade that LTCM and other hedge funds had sizable positions in at the time was long Russian bonds because of their extremely high interest rates. In August 1998 Russia defaulted on its bonds. To help cover the margin calls on this trade gone very wrong, the holders of these positions had to sell other positions they held, which were primarily their European interest rate convergence trades. When they all tried to liquidate this trade at the same time, they found there were no buyers because anyone who wanted the position already had it on. This trade ended up blowing up LTCM and Salomon Brothers. (Location 1446)

The euro did come into existence, and European interest rates did converge. But because the participation in this trade was so extensive, most of the people who had the trade on lost money, (Location 1452)

Don’t have an opinion. We used to have a saying in Hong Kong, “Should’ve been up, but it’s down, so short it; should’ve been down, but it’s up, so long it.” (Location 1476)

It wasn’t a matter of confidence; it was what I was going to do. There were no two ways about it. I was going to figure it out. (Location 1485)

the typical signs you see in a market bubble— the proverbial shoeshine-boy-giving-you-stock-tips euphoria. (Location 1497)

Looking at the COT reports, I saw that the data never provided a sell signal until January 2000. I thought, “That is powerful data.” (Location 1500)

[The Commitment of Traders is a weekly report issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that shows the breakdown of futures positions held by speculators and commercials (industry participants). (Location 1502)

there will always be an equal number of long and short positions in each futures contract, the commercial and speculator positions will move inversely to each other. The underlying premise of traders, such as Jason Shapiro, who use the report as a market indicator, is that commercials will tend to be right (because they are better informed) and, by implication, speculators will tend to be wrong. (Location 1506)

While the small guys may have been buying stocks and making money in late 1999, the large speculators knew it was a bubble and were short. The bull market didn’t end until they got squeezed out. Once they all got squeezed out, the market topped because there was no one left to buy. The COT report picked up that information. (Location 1512)

I don’t just trade on the COT numbers. First of all, I need price action confirmation, and second, I have tight stops. (Location 1522)

The lawyer told me that his wife and Helmut’s wife were best friends. I told him that if he wanted to be my divorce lawyer, he had to get his wife to introduce me to Helmut. (Location 1560)

When I was traveling through Burma, I spent a month in a monastery, and my attitude is that you should always be satisfied. (Location 1588)

I was a kid from an upper-middle-class background who was given everything he needed and took advantage of it to the extreme. And here I was walking around in Burma, and these people who didn’t have two dollars to their name were giving me food to eat every day. It was a very humbling experience. (Location 1600)

Happiness— spending your day doing what you want to do. (Location 1610)

catch-22 (Location 1625)

Having a full-time quant assigned to me allowed me to quantify a lot of what I was doing. (Location 1630)

It’s hard to see what a winner looks like, but it’s easy to see what a loser looks like. I thought to myself, “I’ve been there.” The things James was saying and doing were exactly what I was thinking and doing when I blew up in Thailand. (Location 1640)

“What would you do if they stopped publishing the COT numbers?” I tell them that I can trade right off of CNBC. (Location 1648)

You don’t fight the tape. Be patient, and the market will tell you when. The low of the reversal day will be my stop. I’m not going to argue with it. (Location 1656)

You need both the market positioning and the market action. (Location 1665)

All these people think they are smarter than the market. Again, I’ve been there. They are not. (Location 1694)

The most powerful word in the markets is “despite.” If you hear or see a comment like, “Despite the increase in oil inventories being much higher than expected, oil prices closed higher,” that is the tape telling you what is going to happen. (Location 1695)

It’s never a coincidence. That’s the point. Adam was a sample of everyone else. The fact that the chat started lighting up was itself a sign that the market was at a capitulation point. (Location 1713)

I had six people working for me, and I hated it. I didn’t like managing people and being responsible for their success. (Location 1752)

a book called How Nature Works by a famous physicist named Per Bak. (Location 1764)

What barrier? Most people didn’t want to have the stigma of being involved in the pot business. I didn’t care about any stigma. (Location 1777)

these are 24-year-old kids who didn’t go to college and are working at some blue-collar job. They didn’t have the $ 150,000– $ 200,000 startup cost for setting up a growing facility that could generate $ 400,000 a year in revenue. I started building these facilities and then renting them out at $ 6,000 a month. (Location 1783)

I look at the market all day. I’m paying attention to the market correlations, especially the correlations of the positions I am in. If I see that I am concentrated in positions that are all moving together, I will either reduce my position or put on a position that will be inversely correlated. (Location 1822)

By definition, everyone can’t make outsize returns. So if everyone is doing something, the only way to make outsize returns is by being on the other side. (Location 1859)

Being a contrarian works in the markets, but it doesn’t work in social situations. (Location 1864)

People get into such one-sided views that their logic disappears. (Location 1871)

I succeeded because I have failed so many times, and I had an open mind about failure and was able to learn from it. (Location 1887)

Everyone understands that the market is a discounting mechanism. What they don’t realize is that the discounting mechanism is not price; it’s participation. It’s not that the price has gone from 50 to 100, and therefore the bullish fundamentals are discounted. Instead, it’s everyone is long, and consequently, the bullish fundamentals are discounted. (Location 1919)

a market’s discounting mechanism is based on speculator participation, not price, (Location 1932)

“Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” (Location 1947)

He looks to be on the opposite side of extremes in speculator positioning, or equivalently, on the same side as commercial positioning. (Location 1953)

For timing his contrarian positions, Shapiro will look for market reversals that occur despite a preponderance of news in the opposite direction. Markets bottom on bearish news and top on bullish news. (Location 1956)

participation. Markets bottom because speculators are already fully positioned short— a condition that will naturally occur in an environment of pervasive bearish news. A similar explanation would apply to market tops. (Location 1959)

If Shapiro is not stopped out of a trade, he will hold it until his COT-based oscillator turns neutral— an approach that will often require holding a position for months and through multiple market gyrations. (Location 1976)

if you know or can identify traders or commentators who are reliably wrong— a task far easier than finding those who are reliably right— then their opinions could well be useful in a contrarian sense. (Location 1981)

I write a market letter every weekend and have been doing it for 20 years. (Location 1994)

The three most important things to succeed in trading are patience— the ability to wait for the right trade rather than feeling you have to trade all the time— discipline, and risk management. (Location 2039)

#### Richard Bargh: The Importance of Mindset
Bargh maintains a spreadsheet with columns for different attributes, which he monitors daily in a self-awareness ritual. These items include focus, energy, risk management, process, counter trading (trading against the price move, which he considers a negative), ego, fear of missing out, and happiness rating (either extreme— depression or euphoria— being adverse for trading). (Location 2062)

When Bargh judges that he has exhibited weakness in any area, he will fill in the appropriate column for that day. At the end of each week, Bargh reviews the spreadsheet looking for columns with any fill-ins as a roadmap to the areas he needs to work on for further self-improvement. (Location 2065)

“You very quickly tend to forget about last month, last week, or even yesterday. By keeping a journal, you can see what was going through your mind at any point in time and track how your mindset changes over time. (Location 2070)

Bargh credits the Trading Tribe Process (TTP) created by Ed Seykota, whom I interviewed in Market Wizards, as an essential influence in helping him achieve emotional balance in both his trading and life overall. (Location 2074)

There are tribes practicing TTP worldwide, and Bargh runs the London group. Readers can find a detailed description of TTP at seykota.com. (Location 2077)

the movie about Nick Leeson [Rogue Trader], who broke Barings Bank. (Location 2103)

way behind the curve. I was competing against people who had been doing internships all through their college years. (Location 2122)

That tie habit is probably something you do unconsciously. Yes, entirely unconsciously. I only found out about it years later when one of them made a joke about it. (Location 2185)

Typically, trainees spent the first six months on a simulator. The firm monitored your P/ L. (Location 2218)

I found the first six months very difficult because of extreme paranoia. People used to joke about how I was only a few days away from getting fired. (Location 2225)

During the simulation period, I realized that I was only going to be good at trading if I became happy. I recognized early on how mentally tough trading could be, (Location 2264)

Depressive Illness: The Curse of the Strong by Tim Cantopher. (Location 2269)

It resonated with me because it made me feel that I was not alone. It helped me understand that the same thing happens to other people, and there is a strategy for getting out of it. (Location 2278)

I got out of it by brute force self-talk. I remember sitting on the bus back from work and thinking, “You have got to be happy! You have got to be happy!” (Location 2282)

If you are that committed to something and keep your focus on that one task, it’s only a matter of time before it starts working for you. He is that guy. He plugs away. He is proactive about dealing with anything that is holding him back.”] (Location 2363)

You had anticipated the possibility of the trade. You were utilizing the methodology you believed in— betting on an event— instead of using technicals. You were ready for the trade, and you put on the maximum position size. (Location 2394)

I don’t talk to them about trading anymore because my mom is a big worrier. (Location 2413)

every time I feel like I am set in this game, something strikes me back down. (Location 2416)

You work out what will move the market. You find your trade, and you execute. What stops traders from performing well is themselves. Most of my problem was psychological. I would have a good day, become complacent, and then be unprepared for the next event, which turned out to be an excellent trading opportunity. (Location 2420)

One of my regrets is that I didn’t trade more. I was pushing my size to levels that were more than I could comfortably handle, which made me afraid to trade. (Location 2462)

new things pop up when you reread one of those interviews years later. It seems like with more experience, you see things in a different light. (Location 2473)

Most of my mental energy was spent on worrying about whether I was good enough, and whether I would get fired. Instead, I should have been focusing on the process. (Location 2524)

I need to focus my attention on something; otherwise, I will focus on the wrong things. (Location 2537)

I don’t use trend following alone. I combine it with my knowledge of events. (Location 2558)

I didn’t want something a computer could do. My hunch was that if I could easily duplicate the basic trend-following systems, so could anyone else. (Location 2566)

Trend following by itself is insufficient. The critical elements are how you manage risk and how you take profits once you are in a trade. (Location 2573)

You have to trade your personality. You have to feel at peace with how you’re trading. (Location 2576)

keeping losses as small as possible is critical to capital preservation. The most crucial thing in trading is mental capital. (Location 2587)

When Brandt gets into a trade, he expects it to work straightaway if he is right. The best trades just go. If there is any sign that the market isn’t doing that, he tightens his stop for getting out. (Location 2592)

depends on the trade. The more confident I am, the more aggressive I will be with the risk I take, (Location 2604)

People have difficulty in cutting losses because they are afraid of getting out of the trade and then seeing it go in their direction. It’s an ego thing. (Location 2616)

The problem is that you only remember the times you got out, and the trade then went to the target; you don’t remember all the times when you got out, and it saved you money. (Location 2621)

The results were announced region by region. As the night wore on, it became increasingly clear that Brexit was going to win. The market had not priced that in at all. (Location 2636)

I bought US Treasurys. I figured that the shock of Brexit passing would cause a market shift to risk-off trades, which would trigger a rally in US Treasurys. The difference was that if I were wrong, I would probably lose only a few ticks in a long T-bond position compared with a couple of hundred ticks in a short British pound position— (Location 2647)

My goal as a trader is to always be in harmony with my process. So, I am using my feelings as an input to trading. I try to spot in real time when I am trading poorly. (Location 2678)

In analyzing my past drawdowns, I found that I would start to trade poorly but then keep on trading because I was afraid of missing the next trade. (Location 2679)

If I feel like something is not right, I just leave work early, or I might take the next morning off. I will do whatever I can to put my mindset back in the right place. I want to be trading from a state of calm and inner peace; I don’t want any internal conflict. (Location 2681)

that trade shook me up because it made me realize I was capable of doing what I did. It scared me because I thought, “I could do this again.” (Location 2701)

differentiate between the action and the outcome (Location 2706)

Steve helped me see a part of my personality that I hadn’t noticed. Which was? I tended to compare myself with others a lot and judge my performance against them. (Location 2738)

My ingrained response to missing a trade and seeing someone else do better than me was just a bad habit, and bad habits can be changed. Once I was aware of the problem, I was able to change. (Location 2753)

To be a good trader, you have to have a high degree of self-awareness. You have to be able to see your flaws and strengths and deal effectively with both— (Location 2776)

It doesn’t matter if I miss a trade because there will always be another opportunity. (Location 2778)

Opportunities are dispersed. You might have an opportunity today and then have to wait three months for the next opportunity. (Location 2783)

You have to forgive yourself for making a mistake. (Location 2787)

Staring at these screens all day long is like a casino inviting you to click. You have to guard against the temptation of taking impulsive trades. (Location 2789)

If a bad or missed trade destabilizes me, I have rules for bouncing back: Take some time off, exercise, go out in nature, have fun. (Location 2791)

don’t trade so large that fear dominates your trading. (Location 2816)

If you feel uncomfortable about your trading, you should seek to identify that source of discomfort and then modify your methodology to eliminate it. (Location 2817)

The obvious way to execute a trade idea may not always be the best approach. Sometimes, a related market can provide a better return/ risk trade. (Location 2841)

The damage from a bad trade often extends well beyond the loss on the trade itself. (Location 2856)

Traders need to distinguish between trade outcomes and trade decisions. (Location 2858)

Many traders erroneously evaluate their trading based solely on outcomes, whereas meaningful evaluation should be based on whether trading decisions were consistent with their methodology and risk control rules. (Location 2865)

The perfect environment for me is when the markets are quiet, and traders switch off because they are bored by the lack of volatility, but then there’s an increase in volatility. The volatility increase could be triggered by prices moving out of a consolidation area or an event that shakes things up, (Location 2946)

#### Amrit Sall: The Unicorn Sniper
Sall focuses on trading market-moving events, seeking to capture large gains over short time intervals— typically only minutes— by identifying events that signal a high probability of accelerated price swings in the anticipated direction. He implements this core strategy in large-sized positions because his preparation for these trades gives him high confidence about the short-term market direction implied by different event scenarios. (Location 2977)

Sall is meticulous in keeping comprehensive write-ups on every trade he has ever taken and the significant trades he has missed. He groups these trade logs by category, filling multiple binders with trade descriptions. (Location 2980)

After a trade is made, Sall will summarize what he did and what he got wrong and right. At the end of each month, Sall reviews the trade summaries for the prior month. Before any significant expected trade, he will review similar past trade write-ups as analogues for how the market might be expected to react. (Location 2984)

“I will spend some time visualizing and internalizing how the trade might play out. This mental rehearsal allows me to act instantaneously. It includes not only triggers for getting into the trade but also a plan for managing the trade. I will also envision different scenarios (Location 2988)

one thing about life: You never know what is good and what is bad. Sometimes things that seem bad end up being fortunate and vice versa. (Location 3006)

While I was at Reading, there was a presentation by a couple of guys who were ex-LIFFE floor traders from Refco. After the presentation, I shoved a pen and pad at them and said, “Tell me everything I need to know. What books and articles should I read? What blogs should I follow? I’m interested in everything and anything about the practical side of trading.” One of them gave me his card and said, “Call me on Monday.” I was accepted into a trader training program before I graduated. (Location 3011)

For the first year, I didn’t feel comfortable with anything. I was trying everything, and that is what you should do. (Location 3025)

when you look at a chart, it seems like trendline breakouts work. But that perception is a consequence of knowing where to draw the trendline with the benefit of hindsight. What most people don’t realize is that, in real time, there were often multiple other trendlines that experienced what proved to be false breakouts, (Location 3035)

There are only a handful of factors driving any particular market at any given time. It is a matter of being aware of what is relevant to a market and what is priced in. (Location 3063)

I loosened my entry criteria by not sticking to my type of trades. It was the classic mistake of doing well and then loosening up. (Location 3106)

I never want a position where I am hoping that it will work. I had to go through that experience to know the difference between a trade where I have full conviction and a trade where I am hoping. (Location 3124)

With the benefit of hindsight and experience, I can now say that the big trades are pretty simple. You don’t have to go looking for them, but you do have to wait for them. (Location 3129)

Debussy’s quote that “Music is the space between the notes,” (Location 3135)

Trading is the space between trades— (Location 3136)

I always ask myself: Am I in a state of readiness? Am I fully prepared? Am I wasting my financial capital and mental capital on subpar trades instead of waiting patiently for the real trade opportunities? (Location 3138)

Any idiot can make something complicated. When I look back at the trades responsible for my best return months, they just scream out to me, This is a big trade opportunity. (Location 3144)

90% of the time, the market is not going to provide any opportunities, and 10% of the time, I will make 90% of my profits. (Location 3149)

I had a taste of what it was like to have good trades on, and I knew there were going to be more of them. I just had to stay in the game long enough for my stars to be aligned again. (Location 3158)

The Fed’s primary tool for targeting the Fed funds rate is termed open market operations— the buying and selling of short-term Treasurys to increase or decrease the quantity of money and, in turn, reduce or raise interest rates. (Location 3169)

In a sense, quantitative easing is an extension of normal open market operations. When short-term interest rates fall to near zero, (Location 3173)

quantitative easing, which meant increasing the supply of money, as in normal open market operations, but without the objective of decreasing short-term interest rates, (Location 3176)

In practical terms, quantitative easing meant the Fed created money to purchase non-traditional assets (i.e., assets other than short-term Treasurys). Specifically, the Fed bought longer-term Treasurys and non-government assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. (Location 3177)

The Fed’s first quantitative easing move occurred in November 2008 when, to support the mortgage and housing market, it purchased mortgage-related government agency assets and private mortgage-backed securities, a financial asset class for which buyer demand had virtually disappeared. (Location 3181)

I expected the Fed to eventually expand quantitative easing to include the purchase of longer-term US Treasurys. I thought that if and when such an announcement occurred, it would trigger an instantaneous, massive rally in T-bonds. (Location 3191)

I was poised for that one trade. The order was prepared, and my finger was ready to click. My mind was totally focused. There was no obstruction between the newsfeed and me. There was no self-doubt or excitement to compromise my acting on the trade. I was in a state of flow. I was looking for one trade, and I didn’t care about anything else. (Location 3211)

Once there has been enough price movement to avoid getting stopped out artificially, I will put my stop in. (Location 3237)

once you have a position, there is always the possibility of news coming out adverse to your position, and you may not be able to get out quickly enough. Having a stop in eliminates that tail risk. (Location 3238)

My approach doesn’t stop me from putting on a position on an event that may be somewhat priced in because it can still trigger a big move on the day of the event, (Location 3253)

My best trades come from being on the other side of the type of trade I was in— namely, trades in which short-term speculators have it wrong, and I can go against them. (Location 3268)

now that my trading size is much larger, I will no longer take anticipatory trades. (Location 3277)

We had what I called a “celebration” because I wanted to shift my focus to the positive aspects of my situation rather than sulk over my loss. I was grateful to be in a position that offered so much potential for earnings. The fact that I could lose so much money, so quickly, only reinforced the opportunity I had. (Location 3289)

After a bad trading day, I have two options: I can sit there, dwell on it, and let it hold me back, or I can flip it on its head and take control of it. (Location 3297)

After a big hit, I try to minimize the impact on my emotional capital by returning to a calm and centered state as soon as I can. I do a postmortem on the trade, learn the lessons, and move on to the next opportunity. After processing a big loss or drawdown, I have often treated myself from a place of gratitude for all that I have achieved to date. Through this process, I avoid the trap of repeatedly replaying the same negative story, reliving the pain multiple times, and taxing my mental capital. (Location 3298)

If I realize I am having a tough time, I will ground myself and be grateful for the journey. Then I can go out and treat myself. (Location 3310)

The ocean surface is covered with waves and turbulence, but if you dive down, it is calm. We all have the ability in us to dive down into that calm region. (Location 3312)

If you are worried about missing out on a trade, you will be prone to take trades you shouldn’t be taking. If you are emotionally agitated, you may snatch your profits instead of letting them run, or you may hold onto your losers. (Location 3313)

it’s going against standard human emotions. As a trader, you are continually going up against your own emotional limitations. That is why so few people succeed in trading. (Location 3319)

I noticed that, periodically, I would go through losing periods for no discernible reason. So, I started to keep an error log of marginal trades that were resulting in losses. (Location 3329)

Underlying subconscious thoughts, emotions, and behaviors can drive our actions and adversely impact trading. (Location 3331)

The only way I could be successful in making millisecond decisions for large amounts of money is by accessing that calm state. (Location 3341)

I once read that the US Navy Seals use neurofeedback and biofeedback to help them access flow states on demand when in combat. I also read that the hardest part of a Seal’s job was knowing when not to shoot. (Location 3343)

Before a significant trade event, I go through breath work and meditation to center in on the present moment and transcend the chatter in my mind. Over time, I have learned how to access flow states within a few minutes. (Location 3349)

When I am deeply present, everything feels easy. In this “deep now” state, I’m reacting from a subconscious level that represents 95% of the mind’s potential versus 5% for the conscious mind. In this state, I’m creative, and I can process large amounts of information and react without hesitation. (Location 3351)

Through experience, I have learned that when my gut tells me that something is off, regardless of what my research indicates, my gut is usually right. (Location 3358)

I always look for situations where the market initially moves in the wrong direction in response to an event, and then I can go the other way. (Location 3364)

The thing with short-term trading is that you can be “right” and lose money. (Location 3376)

Taking partial profits allows me to lock in “free trades” that offer unlimited upside but zero downside after I’ve taken profit on part of the position. (Location 3402)

At the portfolio level, when I hit a 6% drawdown, I may start scaling back my size and become much more selective on new trades I put on. (Location 3404)

I have been on a slow bleed losing money over a long period, which usually means the market is in a lull period, or I’m out of sync with the market. In such instances, I will begin cutting size back and tighten up my criteria to take only dead certain trades. (Location 3406)

They had a paycheck mentality; they felt they had to make a certain amount every month. The reality is that you may go through long periods when you don’t make anything, or even have a drawdown, and then have a substantial gain. Entrepreneurs understand that. (Location 3425)

If they had killed the negative reinforcement process at the root by controlling their emotions after the first loss, they would’ve been in a much better position. (Location 3436)

They are competitive within themselves and are always looking for ways to improve performance month after month. (Location 3443)

They embrace failure as feedback. They understand that failure is a necessity on the path to success in any endeavor. They realize that something is a failure only if they miss the opportunity to learn from it. (Location 3447)

I am very aware of the characteristics of a good trade, and I don’t hesitate when such a trade presents itself. I am always looking for asymmetric return/ risk trade profiles. (Location 3451)

I’m not looking for instant gratification; I put in the work and then wait patiently for the right trade. (Location 3455)

I don’t attach myself to the outcome of a trade. I keep my focus on following a process. (Location 3459)

I am disciplined, which allows me to leverage aggressively when there is a major trade opportunity. (Location 3463)

you could get that information before it was reported by the newswire services by retrieving data directly from the Florida website. It was market-moving information in the public domain, and I got it two or three minutes before Bloomberg reported it. (Location 3603)

the line between success and failure on that trade was so thin that if I weren’t in a calm state of mind, I definitely would have stopped myself out at the top and had a big down day. (Location 3632)

I accept that being in a drawdown is the natural state of a trader. You spend most of your time underwater just like a shark; you’re an apex predictor coming up occasionally for a big meal.

I saw the attribution to the FT, and I thought it had to be correct. The story was such a complete surprise that I thought I could have my best day ever if it was correct. I decided to take a punt and instantly started buying the euro and selling the Euro Stoxx 50. The story was wrong. The ECB cut rates. The markets reversed so quickly that even though I liquidated immediately, I ended up getting out at the extreme of those moves.

They let me put in an order at 7.01 cents. So I would get filled anytime anybody sold. I was able to cut in line. When I got filled, I would put up my stock for sale at 7.99, and anytime anybody bought, I would get filled. I was almost a market maker. (Location 4870)

I like to buy a whole sector of stocks at the same time. When I get into a sector, I use a shotgun approach. I buy everything in the space— every stock, every related stock. Initially, I buy smaller positions, and then I start researching the idea intensively. I read filings on all the companies. Once I get conviction on the trade, I start pyramiding my positions by hundreds or even thousands of times. (Location 4992)

At this point, I don’t just sit here and look at a company. I will visit the company. If they make a consumer product, I will buy it and see if I like it. If I don’t like the product, I won’t trade the company. (Location 5005)

I turn myself into an expert in each of the sectors I invest in. (Location 5012)

      3. being in the right sector;
      4. having a catalyst or story that will make the stock or sector move up.
      Once the four corners are in place, you can then fill in the pieces: details on filings, checking into what management has done before, trying the product, and pyramiding your position correctly.

What’s next? Always look for the next big opportunity. Understand when you get out of a position that’s not acting right, you can always get right back in. Look for 10 to 1 return/ risk trading opportunities. (Location 5265)

Extreme position concentration has worked for Neumann because of three factors. First, he has a high success rate on his high-conviction trades. Second, he scales into his positions so that by the time he has as much as one-third of his account in a single stock or single sector play, his average entry price is much lower, providing him with a substantial cushion if the stock starts falling.

This type of methodology is so foreign to them that their lack of comfort and confidence in this approach would lead them to move much more slowly on the trade than I would, if they made the trade at all. (Location 5967)

If I believe the information could potentially be significant, I then have to determine to what degree it has already been disseminated to the investment public.

books by Keith Fitschen, Larry Connors, and Howard Bandy, which discussed mean-reversion strategies. (Location 6767)

For the long mean-reversion system, the underlying requirement was that the stock had to be in an uptrend because you don’t want to buy a stock that keeps going down and down. Then the following condition was that the stock had to be down a certain percentage from its recent high within a given time frame. If these two conditions were met, then I would enter a buy order a specified amount lower, with the exact amount lower based on the stock’s average daily volatility. (Location 6771)

For a mean-reversion long trade, you enter on a limit order as the market is dropping, and you wait for a day with a higher close to exit the position. (Location 6781)

with mean-reversion trades. If you are going long, it implies that you are taking the position because the market has fallen too much, too quickly. If you then use a stop-loss order, and it is activated, by definition, you would be getting out at an even more extreme point, which would make the rules somewhat self-contradictory. (Location 6788)

I exclude biotech stocks from the universe of possible shorts because they have the possibility of multiplying in price in response to drug trial results or FDA decisions. (Location 6801)

how do you define a mean-reversion short trade? Typically, these signals occur as part of a blow-off top in a major uptrend without any intervening correction. You are looking for a particularly prominent short-term upmove— namely, a large percentage price rise in a short period. (Location 6812)

At the end of 2014, I decided my classic systems had lost their edge and that I would trade only the new mean-reversion systems going forward into 2015. And I was determined not to miss out this time, so I foolishly decided to allocate 120% of capital to them. The new systems did very well for the first four months of the year, gaining over 25%. My cumulative profits even hit a new high in May 2015. However, the rest of the year was a disaster. (Location 6823)

losing trades can cluster together in time. It was the “eats like a bird, shits like an elephant” phenomenon. (Location 6831)

Sall and Neumann are exceptionally skilled traders who have a high success rate on their strong-conviction trades and are quick to liquidate when a trade starts to move against them. For most ordinary traders, taking huge positions, no matter how high their conviction level, is a risky proposition. (Location 8065)

When traders, particularly novice traders, lose money in a market, there is a reflexive instinct to try to make it back in the same market. This impulse, perhaps driven by a desire to seek revenge or to expiate the prior trading loss, leads to emotion-induced trading, (Location 8130)

On election night 2016, as the returns started indicating a surprise Trump victory, stock indexes sold off, as was anticipated in such an event. But then, even though a Trump win became increasingly likely, the market reversed sharply to the upside.

In my early years of college, I was pro-government, a stance that was primarily a reaction to the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), a radical anti-war group. I hated their tactics of shutting down colleges as a protest against the war. However, I was always a close follower of the news and political events. My views changed as I discovered the government was guilty of lying about crucial aspects of the war. (Location 8464)

The number of scholarships was cut sharply, and my grades were not good enough to retain mine. I could have continued without a scholarship, but I decided to stop at the M.A. level, get a job, and presumably return to school to get a Ph.D. after several years of work. As it turned out, I fell into a successful career and never pursued any further education. (Location 8514)

I spent a week at the Grand Army Plaza library, which is Brooklyn’s version of the New York Public Library in Manhattan, reading anything I could find on the copper market, which included years’ worth of various periodicals, ranging from annual to daily.

I was hired to replace the New York analyst who was leaving to become a trader. That analyst was Michael Marcus, who would later be the subject of the first trader chapter in the first Market Wizards book. Michael was also the contact for other traders in the first Market Wizards book. (Location 8574)

I got a call from the Los Angeles Times asking me for a comment on the sugar market, which I provided. I thought it was ironic that I was being quoted by a newspaper as a market expert when I had all of two weeks’ experience. (Location 8583)

Follow your talent. Choose what interests you. Don’t settle for less than your best. Be honest. Believe in what you can achieve. (Location 8913)

“Be honest” is a core principle if you want to have long-standing relationships. It also relates to trading because you must be honest with yourself. (Location 8931)

“Believe in what you can achieve” ties into getting what you want. If you don’t have that belief, you won’t achieve your goal because you’re the barrier to getting what you want. (Location 8933)

### Appendix 1: Understanding the Futures Markets24
The essence of a futures market is in its name: Trading involves a commodity or financial instrument for a future delivery date, as opposed to the present time. (Location 8987)

The futures markets allow equal ease of going short as well as long. (Location 9009)

In the futures markets, margins do not imply partial payments, since no actual physical transaction occurs until the expiration date; rather, margins are basically good-faith deposits.) (Location 9014)

In general, futures prices are no more volatile than the underlying cash prices or, for that matter, most stocks. The high-risk reputation of futures is largely a consequence of the leverage factor. (Location 9017)

the trader would not take delivery even given a desire to maintain the long gold position. In this case, the trader would liquidate the December contract and simultaneously go long in a more forward contract. (This type of transaction is called a rollover and would be implemented with a spread order.) Traders should always avoid taking delivery, since it can result in substantial extra costs without any compensating benefits. (Location 9034)

futures markets are still commonly, albeit erroneously, referred to as commodity markets, and these terms are synonymous. (Location 9067)

the majority of futures trading activity is concentrated in financial instruments, many futures traders are, in reality, traders in stocks, bonds, and currencies. (Location 9070)

Right or wrong, the trader will offset his short position before the last trading day, eliminating any need for actual ownership of the commodity. (Location 9081)

return levels only have meaning in context of the risk undertaken to achieve those returns. (Location 9085)

Excess return is the return above the risk-free return (e.g., T-bill rate). For example, if the average return is 8% per year and the T-bill rate is 3%, the excess return would be 5%. (Location 9098)

The Sortino ratio is defined as the compounded return in excess of the MAR divided by the downside deviation. (Location 9118)
